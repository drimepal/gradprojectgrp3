2,Restaurant Oriental,4.2,4.0,"Pretty hidden place that it's only findable if you check the yellow sign on a big, busy street. It's worth going in!

The staff is nice and the food is of quality, with a lot of special flavors and different tastes. It tastes more like Chinese food than other places and they're specialized in Szechuanese food, which is extremely spicy for people not used to it. So if it says medium, don't trust it!",3 years ago,√Ålvaro Chicote

6,Spice rootz,4.7,5.0,Discovering spice roots has been one of the  many best things that happened to me in Norway.  The hospitality and ambience is unmatched. We got a chance to try multiple items and everything tasted unique. Prrsonally I don‚Äôt like when the experiments are done with authentic Indian food and the chef here tried his best to recreate the cuisine in a unique way. But to my surprise he succeeded with all 5 stars !! Loved the way the flavours were blasting in every dish we tried. Would love to try every single dish on the menu soon üòç. Loved the gur wali chai in the end ! Great work ‚ù§Ô∏è,6 months ago,Jolly Narula
7,Spice rootz,4.7,4.0,Very cozy place. Food is always good. This was our second time visiting there for dine in. Many people also come for take away. Good parking place and posh neighbourhood. Employees were helpful. It would be good to invest in couple of air-purifiers.,3 months ago,Asif Touhid
8,Spice rootz,4.7,5.0,"Unlike other restaurants within Oslo, Asker and B√¶rum, here every gravy tastes different and it's hand blended spices by the chef himself!

Other signature naan that you will find is the Spicy naaan! It's Yummillicious ‚ù§Ô∏è

Wonderful ambience and lovely staff! Most humble chef who checks with every customer who drops by! Would definitely recommend you all to visit! I have already visited it 4 times within the last 4 weeks‚ù§Ô∏è",2 months ago,Leena Sahu
9,Spice rootz,4.7,1.0,"I spent a quarter of my adult life in Delhi, and another quarter in Europe. This is one of the disgusting ""Indian"" food I had from both the worlds.

Mislead by the positive reviews, I ordered butter chicken, kadai chicken and butter naan.

The nan was like a pizza base or middle eastern Khubz. Butter chicken was too sweet with added sugar. The grilled chicken in the butter chicken was red in colour. I felt it was marinated in food colour (no chilly can give this colour). The karai chicken was disguesting in appearance and taste. Seems the oil in the food was rancid, I still get bad reflux.

The other ""Indian"" restaurants I have been (Zouk, Tika Tika) in B√¶rum are equally bad. I guess, I have to go to Oslo for good food.",2 years ago,D A
10,The Golden Chimp,4.4,5.0,"Lovely dumplings! My favourite was the king crab. Every dish has just four pieces, but after a while they are actually surprisingly filling. We didn't have a reservation, but even though they were fully booked, they were able to seat us by a table next to the kitchen, which turned out to be really cozy. Tip: get a side dish (like the kimchi) so you have something to nibble on while waiting for the dumplings. A little pricey, but the quality makes it worth it. The only disappointment was the dessert in my opinion, but that's not enough to deduct a star.",a year ago,Lasse R√∏vik
11,The Golden Chimp,4.4,4.0,"Most of the food were really good especially the kimchi.
Attentive waiters and they interact with us very well. Sakes is a must. Wines doesn't really match the food. Dessert nothing special. Hoping they will get comfy chairs & tables.",a year ago,Cindy Laserna
12,The Golden Chimp,4.4,3.0,"I had a special autumn 5 dish course. Their dim sum was really good, not authentic but more fusional in a great way!
Korean fried chicken didn't have that spicy/sweet taste at all. I was a little disappointed.
Their dessert, apple pie dumpling wasn't so impressive. But my partner liked it.

Conclusion: Some dishes were really good. Therfore I want to come back again and try a la carte next time!",3 months ago,Ryo M
13,The Golden Chimp,4.4,4.0,"Nice place to have a nice dinner!
Definitely recommended.

A bit more expensive than average but can do.",2 weeks ago,Laura Curcio
14,The Golden Chimp,4.4,2.0,"As a brief review, this experience was mediocre. We purchased the tasting menu and wine package, which ended up being around 3600kr for two people. Paying this price, I would expect all of the food to be not only tasty, but at the very very least well cooked. Unfortunately, some of the dumplings were doughy and chewy, and just not properly cooked. The fried dumpling topped with chanterelles was very underdone on the inside, and the chanterelles themselves were soft and mushy. The soup dumpling had tough dough on the outside and a sticky, underdone layer on the inside. I admit that everything did taste quite good, but the overall composition and preparation was not great, and certainly not worth the money. Aside from this, the server seemed to have a had time explaining the food and the wine, which is fine if they are just new to the job, but they weren't even able to tell us the country the wine was from. Unfortunately, I won't be returning here.",a year ago,Sharon

16,Rorbua Aker Brygge,4.3,5.0,This place is perfect if you want to try traditional Norwegian food for a reasonable price.

17,Rorbua Aker Brygge,4.3,5.0,"Typical Norwegian food restaurant.
Place where to try whale, elk, deer steaks and skewers.
Meals ordered:
- grilled Reindeer steak with potatoes, jam and vegetables. Really tasty and juicy
- whale fried steak with potatoes, jam and vegetables. The whale meat was very soft, with a slight taste of liver.

Perfect service, pleasant atmosphere. Located next to the touristic harbour.",3 months ago,Andrea Curzi
18,Rorbua Aker Brygge,4.3,5.0,The fish soup is creamy. Actually it is more like lobster soup than fish soup which makes it even more tasty. Recommend. Mixed meat is good too. The Boknafisk is Norwegian which is not always available on menus so we tried it here. It actually is half-dried cod which has quite a unique smoky taste. Not bad but I like fresh cod more.,6 months ago,Siu Shan Tam
19,Rorbua Aker Brygge,4.3,5.0,"Ate here on our first night in town to try some local dishes. The taste of Norway looked small when we got it but my husband was full by the time he finished eating it. Not many places had the option to try whale, this was a good way to taste it but not potentially waste a whole entree if you did not like it. I got the reindeer steak which was delicious and perfectly cooked. Staff was friendly, decor was interesting, and location was good. Would eat there again.",3 months ago,Rachael M

26,Espresso House Linderud Senter,3.4,1.0,"The people who work there have a poor service attitude, poor selection of food (nothing gluten-free) and incredibly dirty and messy. Don't try to order ""too good to go"" either. We ordered, paid and met precisely at the pick-up time, but were told that the order was cancelled, - without notification, without explanation and it still said in the app that there were 5 available bags to pick up.

Beers are absolutely 10/10, coming from the sister brewery Beer Flag, you can find a good ale or some good special ones. The alcohol free beverage is not the usual, it ensures a great taste and high quality!
Food: 10/10 traditional Italian, good and full of taste, a total gem in Oslo! The concept is close to the ""osteria"", generous portions, full of taste and high quality ingredients!
Service: 10/10! Everyone is smiling, very gentle and friendly! They also take very care of the new rules, that makes feel safe.

70,Lille Saigon,4.0,2.0,I recently moved to Oslo for work and I tried a few vietnamese restaurants in town. Since my friends told me about this place. I decided to give it a shot. It took almost half an hour since the moment I walked in and when the food was brought to my table. It wasn't even rush hour because I went there around 2pm... I ordered their pork ribs and shredded with rice. As you can see there was hardly any shredded pork on my plate. Not to mention the pork meat was overcooked therefore it was dry and chewy. The seasoning was fine though. Besides the rice was cheap rice not even basmati rice. Very disappointing experience at this place. For me it's way overpriced and I personally don't think about coming back anytime soon. As a result this place only deserves 2 stars in my opinion.,3 months ago,Paul Taek

The team behind La mayor introduces you to delicious and complex Mexican cuisine where traditional food making meets local Norwegian ingredients and a modern view on things.
We have tried their 5-courses menu and were blown away. All the dishes were delicious, but my favourites were halibut with chili, pickled cactus and charcoal pineapple (omg !) served with tortillas; and a crispy dough fritter with cream fraisch ice cream (!) - compliments to the chef!
I‚Äôm sure I will be returning many times to this place, looking forward to the new dishes on the menu.
I hope Mexican wines will make their way to the restaurant at some point ;).

119,La Mayor,4.8,5.0,"Long story short: I recommend this place! If you want a more in-depth review, read on.

I got the 5-course set meal with my partner. I have attached photos of all the courses for reference.

Drinks:
We had a bottle of sauvignon blanc which was really, really terrible... Nutty and sour? Genuinely 1.5/5 But I ignored that and drank it anyway because it was 700 kr and I felt awkward that it had already been opened!

We tried two of the cocktails: the Paloma, and one which was ""spicy"" with tequila I think. I would recommend the spicy tequila one for someone looking for an interesting drink to entertain their tastebuds, and the Paloma for someone who wants a long, fruity cocktail.

Food:
We had a complimentary small bite of beef tongue (?). Whatever it was, it was SO good. Probably my favourite dish and it wasn't even part of the menu! 5/5

- 1st course: scallop, orange and pomegranate ceviche. It's not what I would typically think a ceviche is, but that's what it was described as. The scallops were tasteless themselves, but had that nice squishy texture. All the flavours came from the really really flavourful soup, which was passion fruit and spice. It wasn't necessarily something that I would like to eat more of, but it was (and I know how pretentious this sounds) entertainment for my tastebuds. 4/5

- 2nd course: tamal. I have no recollection of what was in this to be honest, except that it was in a jalape√±o sauce, but it was delicious. 5/5

- 3rd course: white fish tacos. I can't remember what fish this was, but the concept was that it came in this sauce with pineapple in the leaf plate, and soft tacos were served on the side to give one the option to build their own taco. The fish didn't stand out to me, it needed salt, but once I salted it it was good enough. 4/5.

- 4th course: octopus in mole sauce. I had never had mole sauce, from what I remember of the description it is a very complex sauce that contains chocalte amongst many other things... I wasn't a massive fan of the sauce, but I know that it is authentically mexican and it's just a preference. I could tell that the sauce was good, even if not my taste. The octopus was cooked perfectly though! Not rubbery at all. I was so so impressed by this because I adore a well-cooked octopus. It's so hard to get one that's nice and soft and well-seasoned like this. Just for the cooking of the octopus, 5/5

- 5th course: deep fried dessert with orange zest and ice cream. This isn't a dessert I would order otherwise, but given the previous dishes, it was a great choice. It complimented the previous flavours very well. It was sweet enough, but also refreshing with the orange zest. 5/5

The service was very good. The waitors explained the dishes well and were incredibly professional - made it feel like a luxury experience.",2 months ago,Kalina Christev
120,La Mayor,4.8,5.0,"The heavens came down to us in the shape and taste of octopus mole. Done to perfection, such complexity and divine taste.

136,Funky Fresh Foods,4.5,5.0,"Good veg food in a good vibe.
AMBIANCE,
The place looks good, nice decoration and a well balanced use of wood tones, stone and industrial structure.
ACCESSIBILITY.
They have taken some measures to improve acoustics but not enough to really counter the open kitchen sounds. They play music, not too loud.
It‚Äôs all on one floor an has an accessible toilet. Might be nice to ask them to help you with the door when visiting per chair.

MENU
The menu is regular size and has a good variety of vegetarian options, serving different flavours and kitchens.
The order website only works in Nors, no English.

FOOD
Burger was fine, actual veggies-burger and not an attempt to fake meat. A lot of onion though and I chose this one as I didn‚Äôt want a coriander-dish, unfortunately still contained coriander. Portions were not sufficient for a large eater but there‚Äôs side dishes. Price wise I cannot judge as everything seems very expensive to me in Oslo.

Noodle dish had good taste and texture, the fried oyster mushrooms gives it the much needed crunch and chew that reminds of meat.

Fried mystery cubes were ok but texture was spongy and moist. Dip was ok but you get the more watery texture cause of vegan mayo based. Do not recommend this.

Skagenr√∏re was very close knockoff ot the real one. Love that they used chick peas, and picked carrots as fake salomn. It workes so well recommend.

Muffin with vegan cheese was pretty bad, cheese had a bad gooey feeling and did not taste pleasant. Do not recommend this.

Everything was great, from the appetizers to the main course and right through desert, they couldn't miss it either on the big doses or on the flavour.
The waiters are amazing, always caring and right there whenever we needed something. They definitely bring the Mediterranean soul to Oslo, and us being Portuguese, felt very much welcomed.
Save some space for the desserts! They are biiig and worth it.

Oh the only thing they could improve: we heard that it would be a 45min wait for us, and then to another group, and another. And bottom line: all of us were being seated way sooner than that prediction.

197,El Camino,4.0,2.0,"Very disappointing.

How can you call yourself a Mexican restaurant when you don't use any chilli/spices? Had to steal vegetables from my girlfriend's bowl as the burrito hardly had any. I don't think there were any salsa either, only guacamole!",5 months ago,Balder Jacobsen
198,El Camino,4.0,4.0,"The food here is made to please your original taco taste bud needs. You choose from the disc what meat and salads you want.

They also have several kids chairs and the  whole shop is HCP- accessible in one floor, no steps.

My only complain about this shop is that they have doubled their prices in 5 years and is now unneccessary expensive for a mere burrito without any sides. I paid 185 kr for a burrito that is one of their originals that i paid 95 kr for in their early days.

üåÆThe food is very good, simple but very effective, I liked that the burrito and tacos dough is processed at the moment and it doesn¬¥t get wet and soggy for the sauces (+10 points for the dough)! I liked the pork the most, with a mix of guacamole, tomatoes, lime and jalape√±os.
As a suggestion it would be good to have some indication of what ingredients are behind the glass, some stuff is easy to recognise, some not.

Drinks: I ordered a passion fruit daiquiri, and got served a yellow daiquiri. I tasted it, and it was mango. I contacted the waiter and was told they could not make it for some reason he did not know. But instead of aking if I wanted something else they just served me mango.. I was able to get a new one, but would have preferred to be asked in advance. The strawberry daiquiri was good, as it came from a slush machine.

Food:
I ordered the pizza prosciutto e Burrata. I love burrata, but this was the hardest burrata I have ever had. The consistency was more like a mozarella. The crust was not airy, but dense.

248,SKAAL Matbar,4.4,2.0,"This place became our favorite after several visits. Although I don‚Äôt live in Oslo anymore, having a meal at Skaal has become a must-do for me every time when I‚Äôm back here. However, our experience this time disappointed us, big time. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore, at least until they change the menu again. The two stars I gave here are even a bit generous, but one of the stars is for the good wine, the other one gives credit to the good job they used to do.

First, the service had been extremely friendly, helpful and passionate before. I could recall the waiters still smiling to everyone and trying to engage with the customers all the time on full-house rush hours. This time though, some of the waitresses had this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t‚Äù kind of attitude ‚Äî sort of rushing us to order, never explained the food in details like they used to do before, and didn‚Äôt even notice that our water bottle was empty. (Please note that we were one of the 4 tables dining at the time) We were shocked that the service style went from maximal attention down to less than minimal. Worst of all, no one ever asked how our food was, which was incredibly strange. We had 6 dishes, which means they had plenty of chances to check on us but they simply didn‚Äôt.

Second, as mentioned above that no one ever cared to ask if the food was good, here‚Äôs an answer: generally awful ‚Äî bear in mind that this is not a cheap eatery. In regard of the pricing, one of the dishes was good, three were ok, two were just edible.

The only good one was the oysters. They managed to buy good quality oysters and opened them without leaving pieces of shells on the flesh, bravo. The clear slightly spicy sauce served with the oysters, which was obviously allegedly a style of ‚Äúleche de tigre‚Äù, was good. Maybe change the name before Peruvians get mad.

The Bolinhos had good flavors, but were cold inside, and had an unpleasant rancid taste probably from the frying oil. Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka.

Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka. Also because we left the restaurant with disappointment and confusion, and it used to be satisfaction with exceptional food and amazing service a few months ago.",2 months ago,Kinciyang B√∏ng

Once we received our bill they only put 10% when we had more than half a meal thrown out instead of getting to take it home. With how fancy this restaurant is I was expecting better service than this from the staff. The food was still good but the service ruined our experience here.",2 months ago,Asle Saltermark

343,McDonald‚Äôs,3.6,1.0,"Im not sure if I should laugh or cry! Staff seem like they dont take their job seriously. Food sometimes taste weird, got sick last week after eating a cheeseburger. MATTILSYNET where are you?!?! The worst and slowest restaurant in Oslo/Norway - possibly in all of Europe!!! Might be the #1 worst place I've been in all of my life, including restaurants/caf√©s/bars/ all over the world.

19 out of 20~ times I visited = Place is packed with customers, mostly teenagers. If you pay cash you have to play the ""game"" and pray that someone eventually will come to the cashier to take your order. Its a bit like ""hide and seek""  as the cashier is in a blind zone,  though Im fairly sure they know someone is at that exact spot. They act like they dont know you're standing there.

Most employees avoid making eye-contact with you if you go to look for them - EVEN WHEN THE PLACE IS FULL and THE LINE IS GROWING OUT OF CONTROL. Meanwhile the staff seem to care more about making small-talk with colleagues, others are loafing around without any purpose!  One of them seems to enjoy walking back and forth through the restaurant, its like she doesn't even notice the absurd amount of people waiting. Wolt/Foodora riders are also ignored, they get the worst treatment of all.

Every time Im here I see the same staff wandering around the restaurant, I try to understand what ""tasks"" she is doing but I cannot make any sense out of it. I pay attention to her because I dont have much choice but to hang around and wait anyways, minimum 30-40 minutes. Occasionally it takes 1 hour from the moment I step into the place until the time I receive my food, daytime and evenings.

During weekends late at night Im sure its even worse. stay clear at all cost. I wouldn't bother to try but I'd be surprised if it takes less than two hours. All mcdonalds restaurants in Norway are famous for being slow - this one however is taking it to a whole new level. Time and time again I've ended up feeling dumb after I hesitantly convince myself to give them one last chance. Finished!!!!!! Id rather dig for food in the garbage containers than to waste time and money here one more time.

The short, stocky black haired lady and some of the blonde young girls are not suited to work in a restaurant! Maybe the boss is the one I should be blaming though! Best thing to do is to close this dump for good, permanently",5 months ago,Balder Jacobsen

-All our food was suspiciously cold and could therefore not be fresh as we ordered tempura. It certainly wouldn't drop from 220¬∞C to like 4¬∞ in the few minutes we took to get home.
-We got bubble tea, and didn't get a single tapioca Pearl. Which is the entire reason to get bubble tea(!!)
We ordered 4 maki rolls, and got one small lump of wasabi and about a spoonful of soy sauce
-They're expensive. We tried them because we thought it would be fancier. But it didn't even taste good. Though cold tempura is already hard to defend, the breading was stale and tasted burned oil and the tofu was soggy.

It has such rich and deeply flavoured broth, the noodles were soft yet springy till the end of the bowl. The toppings were mostly well executed. A highlight was the eggs which were nicely marinated and had this beautifully silky yolk texture that was somehow missed in many restaurants. What a joy to eat! I did miss the oniony sharpness from the sliced scallions though, and some bamboo shoot pieces were a bit fibrous.

For the sides, I loved the gyoza!  The karaage was good but paled in comparison. Lightly battered, spiced, crispy and not oily and the meat was soft and juicy. However it felt too salty and there was this raw floury feel lingering after each bite.

Still it was overall a solid experience. Tasty food, excellent presentation as icing on the cake, and decently priced in otherwise expensive Oslo.",4 months ago,Nhu Anh Phan

We had the fish croquettes, bone marrow, pork and German potato salad. That bone marrow was the best I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs very indulgent with beef tartar on it as well. And the pork was cooked to perfection. The potato salad was amazing as well.

What could've been better. The service and most of the food.
The service - We had to wait a long time between each course, we thought they had forgotten about us even though it was far from crowded and waiters seemed uninterested. They didn't remove all the plates and cutlery before serving the next course. They didn't fill our water automatically. They didn't present the food only put it down on our table, one waiter did present the dessert. It was all very amateurish.

The food.
The guacamole had dried fish flakes on it but none of us were fond of the combination. Very small servings in general but that is common in fine dining.
The oysters could have been more salty and needed citrus, verdict was too oily.
My family had ceviche and pulled pork tacos. The ceviche was tasteless, needed more of the salty sea flavor and sweetness of the sweet potato was missing. My aunt only got one (!!!) corn kernel.
Pulled pork tacos was too dry, needed some cream or sauce.

634,Prima Fila Restaurant,4.3,4.0,"Food was absolutely amazing, however we had a terrible experience with the staff. Our waiter didn‚Äôt even know how to use the card machine which caused so much frustration when coming to pay, my friend, who speaks italian, had allergies therefore we needed to ensure she got the correct food, however only one person in the whole restaurant spoke Italian. We were forgotten about a lot of the time and had to ask if we wanted something as they never came up to us to take our payment or check if we needed anything else etc

Overall, the food was amazing and the portions were very generous for the price but we wouldn‚Äôt return again as the experience was a lot more stressful than it should be for a customer in a restaurant.",3 weeks ago,Mariella
635,Prima Fila Restaurant,4.3,4.0,"Looking at the title, one would immediately ask as to why then only 4 stars.  That is purely for the price/cost.   This review is for our trip to Oslo in August 2022.  We are vegetarians and love Italian food.  We went to another Italian restaurant and they sent us out empty handed when we asked for Vegetarian options.  We were served by Mario (Not sure if he was the owner, given that he claimed that he was from Portugal), but it was nothing short of awesome. He listened to our needs, made accommodation to entrees and served us very delicious food. He also helped us select our wine and it was excellent.  It is priced slightly above average, but food and service-wise, I would rate them excellent.  If I am in Oslo, I would definitely go there again.",5 months ago,Shekar Chandrasekaran

Pretty good Italian food, served quite fast, despite being highly visited.

To my knowledge we had not a single complaint about the food. The desserts were extraordinary.

- Extremely efficient ordering process, you scan the QR codes at your table and get a text when your food is ready
- Tasty food - the tacos in particular was our highlight!
- Good vegetarian and vegan options

Cons:
- Expensive! Nothing crazy above the rest of Norway but I find you spend more because you buy lots of small portions
- Busy, can be hard to get a seat

The Italian server was great, very friendly and explained quite well although we were only given 1 menu and he was back within 1 minute to see if we had decided. We were 4 of us. I felt a little rushed. We had the Smalhans and all the food was very tasty. However the pasta was very over cooked and all stuck together which was a pity because the taste was delicious. The sheep and the white fish were very good. Also we had 1 gluten free person in the group which they accommodated but for the gluten free dish, they gave 2 dishes with the same amount so 1 person who was not gluten free also had to eat gluten free. I  felt for the price we paid, the portions could have been slightly bigger. The other servers spoke in very low voices when they served the different dishes so it was very hard to hear what they were saying since the place was full and quite noisy. I expected more but looking at the recent reviews, they are not great either so maybe this place is not what it used to be. I won‚Äôt be coming back in a hurry. I forgot to take photos.

737,Smalhans,4.3,1.0,"The first time I came here, it was wonderful. Great food and a unique experience; I truly felt it was one of the best restaurants in Oslo. However I came again last week and it suddenly became the worst meal for the price that I've had. Slow service (though the waitress was very kind and of course it's not her fault), unusual wine pairings, and worst of all, an utter lack of flavour in the food. We literally had to ask for salt to give it some taste, and we normally under-salt our food. Along with that, the fish was was chewy and slightly overcooked, the vegetables were very woody and I had to pull strings of fiber out of my mouth because they couldn't be broken down. I appreciate a good mix of cuisines, but starting off with a makeshift tostada paired with cured meats, then moving to woody vegetables in a bland broth paired with overcooked fish on pieces of salad in bland broth, then overcooked bland fish with capers and zero other flavour, then onto an Asian style meat with bok choy; I mean it was just a strange combination and the paired meals did not complement eachother.

The only decent thing about the meal was the dessert, which was a brownie that could have been made from a Toro package and nobody would have known the difference.

Overall, a huge disappointment compared to the great first experience I had here. For the price I paid and the utterly underwhelming food I received, I don't plan on returning.",10 months ago,Sharon
738,Smalhans,4.3,2.0,"Surprised in a negative way!

- We ordered 2 ‚Äúfull menus‚Äù including 7 courses
- All courses (including the main course) were brought in a single plate for us to share. Many of them felt like they were meant for 1-1,5 person. To give an example: The duck appetizer was only 1 brochette for 2 people - so we questioned if we only ordered one, would it have been the half?!
- Total 7 courses menu took 3 hours : not because we ate too slow, but we waited tooo long in between the courses. Even the cheese plate took more than 20mins to arrive!
The family in the next table had to leave before desert (even though they paid for it).
It seemed like a problem in the kitchen, since there were 4 people to serve - which seemed quite enough for the restaurant.
- We drank a wine definitely overpriced for its quality !! We paid the same price for a much better bottle just one day before in another restaurant !!

Overall: Smalhans is overpriced for the service and portions it offers.

Hotel lysebu

The hotel is located on a quiet part of the mountain. It is cool here and even though you have not got a wide view on the Oslofjord, the view is still very beautiful.

The hotel consists of several buildings and has a very special feel. There is a lot of art in the buildings, as well as a grand piano. I think the hotel is excellent for private parties, like weddings. The most becoming however is the silence (even though a small group of people were a bit loud in the common room, as well as their baby).

The staircase in our building (to be fair, we had an upgrade to a more luxurious room) is made of concrete and smelled and felt like the concrete monastery of Le Corbusier. It had a bit of a ‚Äò70‚Äôs vibe, in a good way, so it gave me a nice sentiment as well. The whole place felt like a nice retreat, excellent for meditation.

The swimming pool is worth mentioning. It is not a depressing smelly tub, but quite big with nice (smelling) and spacious dressing rooms. There is the sauna as well, also very nice. The gym is in that area as well. All included for guests. No fuzz with codes or keys.

Also worth mentioning is that the whole place is littered with quite excellent coffee machines Nespresso (the nice ones) or the WMF machines with beans. There is also quite a collection of tea available. There are nice common rooms to gather with your group. Our (pretty big) room had a nice couch, so we kept it private.

Also worth mentioning: the best breakfast buffet in Norway. There is a lot of choice, but also a lot of fresh and very tasty fruit. Even the orange juice (normally from a machine) tasted as if it was made from oranges. All standard things were there but also honey from the grate, special bread, kn√§ckebr√∂d, fish, vegetables, yoghurt etc. Not the standard stuff, but the good stuff and plenty of it.

Personnel is also very nice and shows a lot of interest. I love that, it means you care, even if it‚Äôs just about your business.

And they care. The hotel is in excellent condition, clean, well taken care of and very nicely designed. I loved the art. Need to mention that twice. It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs the best and nice to be able to give them a full five stars (first time ever; I‚Äôm quite critical). They earn it in every way.

It was not possible to get a cappuccino for at least 2.5 days, the water for making a tea was not hot, the quality of the dinner is vastly exaggerated and the service is unimpressive. The room was not very clean, the showers need maintanance, and there was not enough toilet paper and no telephone in the room to ask the reception for new supplies.

My wife‚Äôs vegetarian dish- pictured with many vegetables on the menu- was just rice, lettuce, and a few tomatoes. Really a bad experience.

However, we were ultimately there for a dining experience and we went there for our anniversary after hearing a lot of good things from other people. The food was simply not good. It was probably the worst food I have ever had in Oslo and certainly the worst for this price range. Nothing was freshly made. They were all frozen dimsum and the fillings were all very similar. A sign of mass production and ready made. Even things like fried chicken that is usually hard to get wrong was not crispy but extremely hard. My suspicion is that it was refried and not fresh. The dessert was also strange. Things were not well presented. The place also does not have a good ambience, feels like a canteen. Many foodtruck such as kinabolle at Vippa offer asian food much fresher and tastier. Together with this price tag of almost 600 nok for a set menu, it is just unacceptable.",2 years ago,Angela Kok

Went for the standard Tagliatelle Al Ragu with homemade bolognese sauce. The main dish was delicious! Not completely to my taste, because I like pasta a bit softer, but still perfect.
Unfortunately, pasta wasn't the only dish I had. I came for Tiramisu... and it was a shocking disappointment. I believe this might have been the worst I've ever had. The cream tasted okay, the coffee was noticeable, quite powdery, but the lady fingers were completely dry. I didn't feel any kind of syrup infused into them. I believe the moisture of the cream was the only thing that separated them from store bought, out of the pack, cakes. It was unbelievable.

If I will ever return, I will stick with the main dish. I really hoped I will have an amazing meal, from start to finish, seeing how many people love it.

Service was okay.

And the prices have increased a bit (that's understandable), but if I'm not mistaken the portions also have also decreased in size. That included the naan bread.

995,Sabrura Sticks & Sushi Markveien,3.5,3.0,"Sushi buffet: A fine balance of fun and disappointing. The place is nice, the food is well presented. The sushi was tasteless and the rice undercooked, The other dishes were fast-food grade, right down to the chicken nuggets. The philippino cooks could do with more training, and the prices were hidden from view. one sign said 199,- for the buffet, another 249,- we ordered some beers, the price for these was also not displayed, and as a result we paid restaurant money for a less-than restaurant experience. the service was non-existent, we had to go to the counter to ask for anything, and the pans of raw chicken marinading right next to the table completed the picture.

1000,SKAAL Matbar,4.4,5.0,"We had brunch here. Although their menu is not big, it has enough variety. We ordered the toast with beef cheek and pork belly burger. Both were delicious and full of flavours. Service was efficient and staff was friendly.",7 months ago,Angie ‚ÄúAngie‚Äù
1001,SKAAL Matbar,4.4,2.0,"This place became our favorite after several visits. Although I don‚Äôt live in Oslo anymore, having a meal at Skaal has become a must-do for me every time when I‚Äôm back here. However, our experience this time disappointed us, big time. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore, at least until they change the menu again. The two stars I gave here are even a bit generous, but one of the stars is for the good wine, the other one gives credit to the good job they used to do.

First, the service had been extremely friendly, helpful and passionate before. I could recall the waiters still smiling to everyone and trying to engage with the customers all the time on full-house rush hours. This time though, some of the waitresses had this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t‚Äù kind of attitude ‚Äî sort of rushing us to order, never explained the food in details like they used to do before, and didn‚Äôt even notice that our water bottle was empty. (Please note that we were one of the 4 tables dining at the time) We were shocked that the service style went from maximal attention down to less than minimal. Worst of all, no one ever asked how our food was, which was incredibly strange. We had 6 dishes, which means they had plenty of chances to check on us but they simply didn‚Äôt.

Second, as mentioned above that no one ever cared to ask if the food was good, here‚Äôs an answer: generally awful ‚Äî bear in mind that this is not a cheap eatery. In regard of the pricing, one of the dishes was good, three were ok, two were just edible.

The only good one was the oysters. They managed to buy good quality oysters and opened them without leaving pieces of shells on the flesh, bravo. The clear slightly spicy sauce served with the oysters, which was obviously allegedly a style of ‚Äúleche de tigre‚Äù, was good. Maybe change the name before Peruvians get mad.

The Bolinhos had good flavors, but were cold inside, and had an unpleasant rancid taste probably from the frying oil. Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka. Also because we left the restaurant with disappointment and confusion, and it used to be satisfaction with exceptional food and amazing service a few months ago.",2 months ago,Kinciyang B√∏ng

Our whole stay we asked for  housekeeping to clean our rooms, but never did such thing! They would just come in and change the bins (one day she decided to give us new towels), but other than that it was always messy which is so frustrating when you expect more from a hotel stay! When we asked the owners of the place why housekeeping wouldn‚Äôt  clean our rooms they told us it was not part of their job description and we had to do that ourselves.

Ventilation just gave up on day two of our stay and it became humid everyday after that, no one would come look at it or fix it.

Hotel breakfast was way overpriced and not at all sanitary. Little to choose from and the fruit tasted like it had been cut from the same knife as the rest of the onions and vegetables.

We had a rather small room ""small economy double room"" and it was really small. One couldn't open two check in luggage at the same time. There were no night desks. So, we had to use our luggage for that. The room itself was clean, yet we could hear noise from the outside as well during the night. Since we were on floor 5, we could not hear anything from the ground floor.

The self check in surprised us, but that's our fault. It was the first time, so before this stay I didn't pay attention while booking. Anyway, we managed to check in and in retrospective it's fine for me.

The room and ventilation systems have lots of dust. Not clean in my opinion.
I got a sinus infection during my stay and I believe it's related to that poor condition.

Blackout curtains and sound isolation between the rooms could be better as well (I could hear my neighbors alarm clock early in the morning).

1124,Eff Eff Oyster and Wine Bar,4.5,1.0,"We went to Eff Eff last night around 10pm and around 2am my boyfriend started puking and puked until 11 this morning. Worst food poisining I've experienced.  He had the French and Norwegian oysters, I stuck with the sardines myself (thank god). I was hesitant to eat Oysters before this but now I'll definitely never have it. Especially not at Eff Eff..

I cannot express how EXTREMELY poor I think this is given that this place is supposed to be specialized in oysters and dont serve barely anything else on the menu. It's a hygiene factor for any restaurant of course to serve good oysters, but it's extra shameful when a hyped place that boasts and brands itself around quality oysters then serves contaminated ones. That if any place is where you should feel safe to eat it. Ugghh..

Luckily I didn't have any myself - which is also why I'm sure the food poisoning came from there (because all other meals we have both been eating the same thing).

And to round off this review,  I'm sorry to say that the service was also mediocre. We ordered all our food before a big company and still got served after they got their food. Quite frustrating when you even have to pay 45kr for bread & butter (greedy in my opinion?) yet need to ask about it because it takes so long to be served. All while watching others that ordered later than yourself get served. Get your orders - and your oysters(!!) -in order girls.

Spicy Hamachi deluxe maki üç£
Nicely prepared maki roll with hamachi and topped with a home made salsa on top. Fish was alright and had the freshness you expect from a norwegian restaurant. The salsa gave the dish a nice sour note and paired well.

Crunchy Maguro (tuna) üç£
Maki roll with tuna fish rolled in panko bread crumbs, that were not fried. First of all the tuna was not really fresh and tasted little, but was acceptable with some panko breadcrumbs on the outside giving some texture and a mayo based dip on top.

Orange chicken bao bun NYC
Not exiting at all, just some fried chicken bits rolled in panko breadcrumb. Topped with orange sauce. Chicken was average but sauce was good with strong orange flavor.

Vegan
Spicy Zakura (Vegan)
The Zalmon or imitation salmon tasted sorta simmilar to salmon. Texture was a inbetween a jelly candy and raw salmon. Flavor was alright but cant call it salmon.

Dirty shrimp maki (Vegan)
Shrimp just tasted like tofu, should just have called it tofu. As it has little to no simmilarities with shrimp texture or flavor wise. Maki was otherwise good topped with a handful of sweet potato fries.",2 weeks ago,D

1171,The Broker,3.9,1.0,"I had a terrible experience having lunch here a few weeks ago.

For one while I had a reservation I was still sent to a table at the very back when all the front areas of the restaurant were empty. The waiter was horrid, it was impossible to get his attention to ask any questions about the food, more than a few times after seeing us needing attention he ignored us and continued not doing anything.

The food was good nothing incredible but pretty decent. We had the burger and fish and chips. Finally we ordered dessert; a tea and an espresso. While i understand that all orders are made through the app it took a very long time to get our drinks and once we got them the waiter informed us that they did not make espresso and left. He did not even give an option for another drink and before we even had a chance to say that we had already payed for it to get the refund. We waited for a good 30 minutes to see if he came back towards are table to let him know but he was nowhere to be found so we decided to leave.

And the few times the waiter did come close to the table was when he went to the kitchen to yell at the chef right behind us which by that point was the only one doing a good job.

It is not that I mind loosing the money for the drink or that the food was bad. It is the terribly arrogant attitude of the waiter which makes me angry.

I would definitely recommend avoiding this place!",3 months ago,Andres Sandoval
1172,The Broker,3.9,2.0,"The food is not bad at all, solid burger, good fish and chips.

Plus we got sent all the way to the furthest away table on the restaurant when there was space in a much nicer area at the front. Server had an attitude and seemed he didn‚Äôt want to be working. I understand that can be the case but you shouldn‚Äôt show that as a waiter. Disappointed with that. Additionally, we ordered an espresso and tea and we couldn‚Äôt get an espresso because supposedly they don‚Äôt have even when it‚Äôs on the menu for you to order.

We had the Brasilia experience and got to try the different juicy and tasty meat they serve. I've never been so full. Aside from our gaucho, we got awesome service from the other staff. The place was clean, even their toilets. It was honestly a bit expensive but for me it's worth the experience. We were very satisfied customers and we will be coming back here again. üëç",a year ago,jerica masa

1282,De Mi Tierra,4.6,5.0,"I have been to Argentina many times where I am always on the lookout for the best empanadas. Even there I have sometimes been disappointed just because there is some much to choose from. So I didn't have any particular expectations when I was scrolling through Wolt and found De Mi Tierra. Also because I don't know of any other place in Oslo selling empanadas.

I received my order and the first thing I noticed was the great presentation. A cute little box as if I had been given a gift. Then I opened the box to find the little gems of empanadas inside. They looked perfect, just as I had remembered the good ones in Argentina. And they all tasted great. Instantly I could tell that these had been made with love, and using authentic flavours. I had the fried ones, but you can also get them baked. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chimichurri sauce also tasted fresh and fragrant. Overall a real delight, and I was pleasantly surprised. One portion of 5 was enough for me.

Again talking about the presentation : the bag, the box, and the pot for the chimichurri are all made from paper (there was also a small wooden spoon). It's a relief to finally find packaging which is recyclable and not plastic ! Small details here, but shows the attention to details.

I would highly recommend. If you want to have a break from all the sushi and burger places, give these guys a try, you won't regret it. Next time I will go to their place in person to enjoy a coffee an alfajor.

1297,Boulangerie M,4.5,5.0,"Original review from @croissantsofoslo (instagram)

A hidden pearl!

We were quite surprised, to find an authentic French boulangerie specimen in Ensj√∏. It was like stumbling across an Edelweiss on a beach in Fidji!

Regardless, the store has all the hallmarks of an authentic boulangerie and they excel at their craft. Just seeing breads and baked goods on trays, fresh out of the oven is worth a visit. Our brightest hope is that Boulangerie M will expand and open more locations around Oslo, so that at last, civilisation through ü•ñ and ü•ê can be brought to our great city.

We only review croissants so here is our opinion on the one we had.

Price: ca 35 nok

Look and feel 5/6:
It is humongous, seldom have we seen such a large ü•ê. It is light despite the volume ,a very good first impression is confirmed by a magnificent cross section. This ü•ê is super flaky, eating ü•ê should be messy and we ‚ù§ this one for it.

Taste 5/6:
Refined and balanced. The butter does not dominate and leaves room for the yeast and dough to express themselves. Great texture with a crispy crust and soft interior.

Value for money 6/6:
Amazing quality for the price, they also have coffee and croissants deals which seem too good to be true.

When to have this croissant:
When you are curious as to what a real boulangerie feels like. If we lived closer, we would be there at least once a week. We also ‚ù§ The cinnamon cruffins but that's another story üòâ.",2 years ago,Croissants of Oslo

As soon as the nachos came, I complained to the waiter that the dish was cold.

You could see that the cheese was not melted, and so was the meat...

The waiter advised: ""Well, that's how we do it here""

Rule nr.1. When working in a restaurant:

The customer is always right, or at least you try to please his/her wills if possible.

The right answer would have been:
""Well sir, we normally just drop some could meat and frozen cheese from the fridge"", but as you are a Mexican complaining about Mexican food I can make the minimum effort of heating it up in the microwave, so that the cheese is melted"".

1409,Handmade Burger & Shake,3.9,1.0,"Was really excited to try this as they recently opened at St hanshaugen! Had a long day and was extremely hungry..
Hunger is the best sauce - but it did nothing to help what ever this was.

Ordered the following:
Strawberry milkshake
Hot chick
Sweet potato fries
Onion rings
Freddy's BBQ
Total of 428 kr

Like someone mentioned earlier, I have not the slightest inkling on  what is actually handmade here... And none of the food came even close to the photos online. I'm inclined to believe they use stock photos..

The bbq burger was ok. The onion rings was the most tasty - I give them a 4/10.
Sweet potato fries was too well done.

The shake tasted like mass-produced factory shake with too much sugar and artificial flavor. If this was indeed homemade, they are doing something very wrong.

I was not even able to finish half of my hot chick. At first I thought they had given me the wrong order, as the chicken looked more like a badly beaten vegan patty. The whole thing was drenched in sauce - Wich tasted like ""a thousand islands"" mixed with chili. And when I say drenched... I mean it, See photo.
Will never come back here and will never recommend, I will go as far as to say I will beg other people not to leave their money here.

The service was great, or at least our server was very informative and attentive and engaging in helping us having a good dining experience. Drinks were also great!
However, the food was not that great. We bought the tickets to the 13-course Sunday Tasting and we concluded that the main problem of the food was the lack of balance. We informed the kitchen that we are very sensitive to overly salted food and they were trying their best to accompanied that. The first serving was great, which consisted of 4 different small bites/snacks. The watermelon tart was the best, and honestly, that is the only single bite that we thought was good and delivered in flavour. The dinner was just going downhill from there. The next serving are the appetizer or mellomrett. We started with a cold, rich seafood broth with mascarpone mousse. It was good but the broth was so condensed with seafood which make it naturally salty and hard to enjoy. The fried scallops were mediocre - the pickled fennel was actually better than the scallops themselves. The burrata tomato salad was very refreshing - great, sweet tomato and creamy burrata. And then a cauliflower dish - both of us were puzzled what exactly it role was because it was very unremarkable. The problem of unbalance started appearing from this serving - all 4 dishes were TOO rich, with excessive amount of cream and fat in total. We were almost full and lost most of our appetite after this serving, which was ridiculous because they were suppose to be appetizer. Then come our main dishes, which we disappointed the most. First was the porchetta, which was inedible for us because it was ridiculously salty. We informed the server and she made her best effort to make replacement. But the kitchen informed that there were no other meat dish to substitute (which is ridiculous because they serve meatballs and chicken on their normal menu everyday and it's not like everyone coming on Sunday will have a Sunday Tasting menu). So they gave us asparagus with beurre blanc sauce. The other mains are a homemade pasta dish - which was again covered in cream and cheese and was very hard to eat when it got cold, a risotto with truffle and cream and cheese (again) - the rice grain was a bit weird and it stick to our teeth constantly, and finally a mini corn dish with confit garlic sauce, which was the only thing we could finish in this serving. Everything was just cream and cheese, too much fat without anything to cut through so it was extremely hard to enjoy the food. The dessert was an olive cake with balsamic vinegar and strawberry compote, served with ice cream. The ice cream is great, I did not think the balsamic vinegar component worked but my sister liked it.

Overall, it was not a good dinner and definitely not worth the money - we paid NOK 1000 for a dinner for two (food only) but what we got was mostly vegetarian dishes. The food was unbalance, and for us, food is the only reason we will ever come back to a restaurant. Thus, unfortunately, we will not come back.",6 months ago,Ngan Huynh Bao

Instead of taking away like most people who came in, my family occupied one of the few  (bar chair) tables in the place. The menu is primarily in Norwegian, but if you're familiar with the typical sushi words 'maki, tempura etc', it's not that difficult to discern what the menu says. The staff politely answered any questions we had, and acquiesced to our request to make half a sushi roll spicy and half not (for dad), which was very nice of them.

In the end we ordered '05' under 'Sushi meny' 'F4' (Futo seafood) and 'F7' (Futo crispy duck) twice under 'Futo Maki'. We'd never had crispy duck in sushi before, but it was delicious!

The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable about the various kinds of Ramen to help you decide if needed. I got the Tantanmen and my wife got the Mazemen. Both have a little spiciness but very good. The cool thing about the Mazemen is that it doesn‚Äôt have a broth and just uses one egg yolk to make it a little creamy which is a completely different experience and makes all the flavors pop! The tantanmen was very good as well and I enjoyed the flavor and heat from the chilis. Definitely try this place out if you are looking for an inexpensive and good meal.,11 months ago,Joshua Russell
1483,Koie Ramen,4.4,5.0,"Was there with my friend yesterday. Ostegata is rn the best ramen in Oslo and closest to the umami taste of Japanese. The tonkotsu was really good. Taste has evolved a lot better and no more corona bland broth lol haha! Creamy qualified clean broth (i mixed up the black drops so it looks mushy in the foto). I ended the dish without remember to add chili oil. So it was a compliment for you. Chasiu was better with no stinky pork and light, even tho it wasnt chared and doesnt taste anything seasoned. Food size was perfectly served out.
Karaage was super cripsy, soft, warm homemade majo was creamy and a litte touch of sour lemon, delicious.
Plus point for being unique with the karaage since japanese shops are never meant to be similar.
I havent order gyoza or kimchi this time, so if you do experience, do tell.
When you see a long snake line outside waiting to eat you know its good.
Shop is casually clean, and bathroom is nice. They just need to check if bathroomwas dirt more often.
Good for a small group and cozy people who love to enjoy a close enough japanese culture, and good for Asians who miss the taste of those local slurps down the streets in the city.üçª

1488,Baker Nordby Gr√ºnerl√∏kka,3.9,2.0,"I often find that the tables are left with cups and plates for a long time and you have to clear them yourself. Several of the people who work there are more concerned with the phone than with cleaning and doing their job. Even when there are few customers, there are cups and saucers on the stalls for guests who have left. Now I just experienced that one employee sat with the phone and pressed, went over to a customer and made a baguette where she touched the food without washing herself or wearing gloves. Right from the phone, checkout, food, to serving. Another time there was a lady who had made out and I told the woman who worked there that they had to wash the chair she was sitting on.
When she washed, she washed the chair/stool with a cloth and then washed over the counter with the same cloth. I was simply shocked. Usually I speak up about things like this but was put out by a total lack of hygiene. I myself never order food here due to hygiene. A few days ago I bought a coffee here and the woman who served the coffee had ""overripe"" pimples that could pop out at any time. I lost my appetite even for coffee.
I recommend that the management address the employees' knowledge of hygiene. There is a big difference here and elsewhere. Several of the people who work here are more concerned with the phone than with their job.

1509,Kinabolle Gr√∏nland,4.4,5.0,"This is one of my two favorite Asian restaurants in Oslo, and I recommend you try the 1) hand-pulled noodles, 2) handmade dumplings, and the 3) sweet and spicy chicken. The noodles are chewy and fatty flavor bombs, and the dumplings and the sauce are a juicy reminder of food back at home. I say this as a Korean-American who spent the last 5 years in San Francisco, and has eaten copious amounts of Asian food in Korea, Japan, China, and at home.

I would like to write a disclaimer that this does not include Vietnamese food. Vietnamese are the 4th largest immigrant population in Norway, so there seems to be a wealth of Vietnamese food around Oslo. Therefore, I think it deserves a category of its own.

If you love reading reviews as much as I like writing them, the following is for you:

1. I can see and feel the care that the women and men put into their dishes
2. They have a small menu and everything on their menu has a reason for being there
3. They have wifi, so if you need to grab a meal and get stuff done, you can do both
4. There is a lot of seating; you'll see once you walk in, there's a larger area inside
5. It's a great place to grab dinner with a group of friends at the end of the week
6. They serve beer and cider for all those who want to loosen up a bit
7. Very reasonably priced with good portions, so if you and your friend aren't that hungry, you can easily share a rice or noodle dish as a snack
8. Admittedly, the ambience could be a little more lively with some music, but easily a place you can fill with the laughter of you and your friends

1517,Mac + Cheese Bar Gr√ºnerl√∏kka,3.5,2.0,"We ordered the mushroom Mac and cheese, and the dirty fries. The Mac was more greasy than cheesy, actually we couldn't taste cheese at all. The only reason we think cheese was in it was because of the stringy texture of melted cheese.
The dirty fries were just fries with some sauce on the top, and not enough to go through the whole dish.
Eating ""in""  was only possible on a bench inside or two small 2 person tables, which was fine for us.

Today, we came back again after 2 days.  The food was very different and had an awful experience.

Two of our main orders were red thai curry (vegetarian) and Pad Thai noodles. We all know Red thai curry is taken with rice, but they made both the dishes with noodles and gave us 2 portions of rice.
Dont know why they made both dishes similar and heavily filled with noodles.

Even after complaining to the staff, that Red Thai curry doesn't usually come with noodles (and also we advised no tofu in Red Thai curry, which they ignored and came heavily loaded with tofus), the waitress simply said that's how it is made.

That was quite rude and you will see the last picture - the bill was paid in full with the portion of Red Thai just like odered new!

1617,Pincho Nation Jernbanetorget,4.1,4.0,"What a cool place! The circus theme is a treat, especially the bathrooms - once you lock the door a monologue by the circus master starts. There's a wide variety of food that can be shared tapas style (portions are not full sized) and an extensive drink menu (three cheers for the bartender who made an amazing drink for the 'surprise cocktail'). Food is ordered via the Princho mobile app and picked up at the service counter - be sure to keep an eye on the app because it is supposed to give a notification when the food is ready but sometimes the notification didn't come through.

The food itself is pretty good. We had the edamame, steak, pad Thai, sweet potato fries, fries, mushroom risotto, mushrooms, spring rolls, hmm can't remember what else. But everything was good, seems like you can't really go wrong.

It would be great if the circus theme was kicked up another notch - maybe some lighter music? A magician that performs on the hour? A person folding balloon animals? More circus-style food?  An actual menu would also be welcome because there are so many options but difficult to get an overview in the app where items are listed one by one which requires lots of scrolling. Other than that, this place is fun!

The drinks menu is wonderfully wide ranging, focusing on beer but covering all kinds of wine as well - and each dish comes with recommended drinks matching, giving options of beer, wine or alcohol free pairings.
The service was friendly and attentive and the food came pretty quickly. When we weren't sure which beer to try our lovely server, Pernille, enthusiastically gave us recommendations which matched our tastes beautifully.

Service was quick, service-minded and polite. We got what we ordered fairly fast. They have great wines, and amazing table bread. Very lovely area to sit and enjoy a glass if wine, but unfortunately we thought the pasta and the food in general was way too salty. The only gluten free option they have is a grilled mackerel, which was also way too salty and a bit of a let down. It felt as though they had dropped a whole bottle if salt in the dishes. *Many italian style-restaurants have more than one gluten free option. Mostly risotto, but here, the risotto was not gluten free. Which sadlg left only one option. We asked for a side salad with the mackerel - got a few green leaves and some chopped red onion...

The ordering experince was very different as they handed a yellow card (not in english) and a pen to write the menu item number and spice level. No one in the restaurant told us the level of spiciness they will add from 1 to 5. We ordered three dishes with level 3 and 4 based on our 5+yrs of experience in ordering in Indian restaurants in the EU. But level 3 and 4 was on a different level!!! We had to get some milk and ice creams in a grocery store nearby to manage the spiciness. We asked about this to the waitet and his response was this is the level they give to indias here!!

Then he said again that there was no reservation. I asked if he can call his supervisor to resolve this issue. After his supervisor made a new reservation, we got the wrong room. We had booked a twin room and the reception gave us a double bed room. I went back to the front desk and they said a ‚Äúroom move‚Äù couldn't take place as apparently cause we had been in the room but we actually didn't use the room. After a long discussion we finally got a room move to a one with two separate beds. On the next day I received an email from Sofia E that we have not paid for our reservation and that we had to pay, while we had actually paid at check-in. The reception knew nothing about this email, which I found quite strange. Not even an apology was offered for the inconvenience.

1736,Nimbu Indisk Restaurant,4.1,4.0,"What a place! It‚Äôs probably the best Indian cousine I‚Äôve had. Butter chicken was excellent, truly great, curry packed with layers of flavour. Chicken was creamy, smooth and almost melted in my mouth. We also had the Rogan Josh, which had the most tender chicken we‚Äôve had in years, with a very strong red sauce. Naan was also excellent. However, for two people, one small bowl of rice just wasn‚Äôt enough. Either make it bigger or give each person their own. We had to order extra naan to compensate for that part.

Service was very good, allthough we had to wait a while to order, same thing with getting the bill. This seemed to be a problem for others as well. Our waiter was nice and pro active, where some of the others didnt seem to care all that much about us at all. Almost like they avoided us.

Restaurant was very calm and relaxed. Almost like being in a spa. Interior was nice and modern as well.

1740,Hos Thea,4.8,5.0,"I have to say, it was a great experience with great food and services, will definitely come again if ever visit Oslo. You do not want to miss this place if you want some Norwegian cuisine.

-Environment & Location
Nice place, cosy and clean, not many tables available, make reservation before you go. Not too far from city centre, tram station is nearby.

-Food & Drink
Provides both meat and fish menu, you can choose your type of meat for the meat menu main course, but not for the fish menu. The combination was just great, you can taste every flavour listed on the menu. Love the small club sandwich with quail great and foie gras, surprisingly delicious. Wine pairing was great with the food, excellent selection. The dessert was slightly below standard, maybe can have better choices.

-Service
Great service, as the place is small, the waitress was able to take care of all the tables. She even top up my wine after she seen my glass was empty before I finishing the appetiser.

1744,Tveita Senter,4.0,5.0,"Conveniently placed shopping center (right by the metro) with a vibrant atmosphere. Always buzzing with life, especially from the elder population of Tveita, which often convenes here to socialize. There is a decent selection of shops spread across 3 floors. There are just 3 downsides in my opinion:

(1) the shops are quite ""sterile""‚Äîtypical Norwegian chains, not much diversity. When I first moved here, there was a small ""immigrant""/independent shop that offered a bit of ethnic diversity. It was unfortunately swallowed up by more common chain businesses.

(2) despite signs saying that smoking is not allowed by the entrances, there are often people standing right by the doors smoking (including employees on break). No one regulates this, and it is especially frustrating if you are pregnant or passing with infants and children and have to wait to get through the slow revolving doors. This is perhaps the greatest downside.

(3) eateries are limited to 2 Norwegian chain bakeries and 1 Norwegian chain cafe with too-large portions. I personally would've liked to have a more creative or proper eatery (Norwegian or other cuisine) that offered a cozier vibe and better atmosphere for the younger generation. But this point is a small detail. It's quite nice that we have the options we have. (*There is also a decent sushi place just outside.)

Noodles went a bit soft, and the broth wasn't my thing. The mushrooms in it were lovely, and loved the spring onions!!

We were lucky to be sat in the ""good"", darker side of the restaurant, where the atmosphere was nicer. The other half was bright and a bit bare.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I was led to my table, seated next to the most beautiful wine cooler/fridge I have EVER seen. Maybe 4-6 cubic meters in size, it was made of transparent glass, illuminated with many different colors, making the wine bottles inside sparkle and shine. I was already sold.... üò±üòç

I ordered a 20 piece combo platter for 399 NOK. Very reasonable price for that much sushi in a restaurant. When it arrived, it looked like food art that shouldn't be touched, just gazed upon in awe....
It tasted like a piece of heaven. Half of the pieces had flavored sour cream on top of them. Sounds unusual maybe, but all I can say is - TRY IT! Melted in the mouth.

To make things even more interesting, the waiter that served me turned out to be the operations manager. He shared about the other branches in Bergen, a new opening in √Ösane soon (close to home), and... Told me that if I liked the decorations in the restaurant, I really should go to the bathroom.... üòÇüôÉ You will understand why if you check my pictures.

-There is no parking spot for big buses - if you are lucky and it's weekend, they will send you to park at school (very tight entrance). So typical 'we would like to have groups, but we don't care where you park'.
- make triple sure that if you contract breakfast for some time, your group will get it. We had breakfast contracted for 7.00, but instead of 'great breakfast' we get packed bags with full of plastic to waste and people with alergies went off hungry.",a year ago,Micha≈Ç Bus≈Çawski

First I had foil, solar film and various other things done to the car. After some comparison with another car, I noticed a fault with the solar film, but the company denied this. Then got foil myself and proved their mistake, still refused but was able to get someone else to look at it. Another fitter looked at it and confirmed that the solar film was of the wrong percentage.

Was asked to deliver the car early and pick it up this afternoon. Delivered the car early, called this afternoon to check the status; hadn't started, but it shouldn't take long. Waited until 22:00 in the evening, no phone. The next day I could pick up the car, which was actually ready at 19:00 the day before, but this was probably too late to send a message/call.

Now 4 weeks later I have a debt collection claim for a parking ticket that my car received while it was parked there.

2112,Baker Hansen,4.3,1.0,"Terrible ""chicken breast and pesto"" toast. Cheese was some sort of cheap block ""mozzarella"" that had a foul flavor like rancid oil or soap. Pesto was nowhere to be seen and what little was there didn't add any flavor. Salad leaves and onion that were stuffed in by the barista after it was toasted did not make the toast worthwhile, if anything onion slices made the cheese more rancid. The chicken was dry and the only thing that held any flavor, but was less like chicken breast and more like ""Coop grillet kylling"". Which can be delicious  but this is a 100kr sandwich, not a homemade br√∏dskive.
An incredibly disappointing experience altogether. The prices are stiff and there's barely room to sit inside, 100kr for this toast was a scam and 60kr for a small cake slice is not worth it.

Cozy outside seating though, but service wasn't great. The barista gave me some mean looks and didn't include any napkins or cutlery in my take away bag of a sandwich and two pieces of cake.",3 years ago,Luna Udbj√∏rg

2210,Pascal,4.2,1.0,"Definitely one of the worst experience I have ever had, both when it comes to the food and the service.

We were placed at a table where the chairs were well decorated with food scrapes which we wiped off with hands. I then asked the waitress to give it quick clean with wet wipes. When she came with the wipe, she looked at the seemly clean chairs and asked ""where is it dirty"" and refused to help with further cleaning.

Being somewhat famous as a confectionery, we ordered the petit fours from the menu which includes a selection of macarons, confect and truffles. The same waitress then just took off without caring or asking at all which flavours we would like to have.

So I went to counter to pick the flavours. Not only were they short of 50% of their flavours listed in the menu, the waitress had also rather little idea of which products were the right flavours that I ordered (probably also because of the absolutely messy labelling).

The kids ordered brownies, and without a doubt those are the dryest and most flavourless brownies I had encountered... I guess that's why they suggested ice cream with it.

On top of this, we also order drinks and a coffee. Drinks came without glasses, and the coffee never came. And for some reasons, our table was also not given any water whilst all the neighbour tables got water with glasses.

I see no reason why they should be famous and can only recommend anyone to avoid wasting money there.",7 months ago,Xiaojun Cristin

I normally tend to buy the Croque Monsieurs here as they are exactly the same as the ones I used to have in France, but their Romano salad is out of this world and a 'must try' if you come here. We buy their coffee practically everyday at work.

You need to try the anchovy sandwich, chicken p√¢t√© and the steak tartare with chipotle (I hope the three will always stay on the menu). I only minor comment would be to serve more bread with the chicken p√¢t√© and more nachos with the steak tartare.

It was neat to try seal, whale and the portions were huge, as well as fresh caught, and priced were reasonable but everything you could order was cooked the same with minimal seasoning, which is fine with fresh caught fish but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a place to get a more ‚Äúhome cooked, maybe cheaper, Filling meal with no bells and whistles‚Äù staff was not very helpful, she couldn‚Äôt tell me main differences in style of each dish so just said, ‚Äúorder this, it‚Äôs popular‚Äù.And we asked for veggies vs potatoes and just got the salad side that came regardless with no extra, which is fine but still. Staff played on her phone the whole time and we had to ask to order, for the drink menu a second time and for our check.  Decor was tacky but cute, and it was empty so no wait to sit, just wait for the staff to get off her phone (which I have to say  she did do once we approached her). We were told by a local chef we met having beers it is very touristy (and yes we found it in a popular tour book haha) also a semi far walk from town area but I still thought it was good.

We ate from the buffet and had first 1, then 2, then 3 dirty dishes on our table. The waiter passed several times with empty hands, without collecting. Eventually I moved the dishes to the empty table next to us. Within 5 minutes another personell member (his supervisor?) asked whether i had put the dishes there. When I confirmed that, i got a lecture about what that would look to new guests who would be using that table, and what I would think if she had put a stack of dirty dishes on our table.
When I mentioned the dirty dishes had been on our table for at least 15 minutes i got a 'they will be picked up as soon as possible ' (even though the aforementioned waiter had passed (and seen) the dishes several times without collecting them).

2530,Lille √ì,4.6,5.0,"Amazing place. A gem that just opened.

First visit for me in Sep2022. There will be many more.

The ex dreamteam from Grisen has transplanted in this stunning house the same great service, and somehow concept, from their previous restaurant. Expect a short menu, with more focus on quality than quantity, emphasizing nordic/Norwegian food with European touch.
The efforts on deco are totally impressive (More typical of London or Hong Kong venues really). Will become even more ‚Äúkoselig‚Äù with time. Great outdoor seating also - to be tried when spring returns.

The historical house where Lille O finds its home  (and the entire neighborhood actually) are just amazing.  An architecture pearl, combining new and old very nicely.

2532,Lille √ì,4.6,2.0,Very unoriginal lunch menu with just three different dishes plus a dish of the day. I decided to go for the dish of the day which was pork neck. The dish was small with just some normal coleslaw and boiled potatoes. Not very exciting at all. Worst of all was that the potatoes were really undercooked. I told the waitress and she returned the dish to the kitchen. When I finally got it back the potatoes were still undercooked! So for the second time I told the waitress that the potatoes were undercooked. This time I didn‚Äôt want to risk it anymore so I asked for the hamburger instead. Whilst I was waiting for the hamburger the manager came out to apologise and said that I didn‚Äôt have to pay for the burger. Very professional of him. The hamburger was tasty but the fries were not properly fried and a bit soggy. The staff in general is not very attentive and it takes a long time even to get the drinks you order. Also they did not have any sodas without sugar which I found really weird. Probably not a place I will come back to.,9 months ago,Bendik Taarneby Gotteberg

2584,Handwerk,3.7,1.0,"It pains me to leave a bad review for a place that has so much potential. We chose the cafe  to have lunch after our wedding last week (June) with 11 guests, around 1PM on a Friday. Their website advertises about emailing them for group orders, in which reservations can be made for larger groups - both outdoors and indoors if the weather isn't great.

I emailed them in April. It was confirmed that it would be no problem to make a reservation + pre-order food, and reserve the small indoor room. Initial back and forth communication was fine. I asked if the menu was up to date and told yes.

I sent over our selections from the menu in late May. I didn‚Äôt hear back, sent a follow up email, and subsequent phone call. I called again two days before the wedding, and was told the menu changed, so none of the things we ordered were now available (ie. Hot chicken, Brunch sampler plate, etc.) I ordered simple sandwiches, thinking they would at least all be ready for us when we arrived.

When we arrived for our reservation, nothing was prepared. No tables outdoors reserved or wiped down, the indoor room had other guests sitting in there so there wasn‚Äôt room for us when we got there. Our guests tried to piece together some outdoor tables, which still had other past cafe guests food on them.

We went up to the counter to ask what was going on, but the workers had no idea what reservations we were talking about. It was complete chaos and a disappointing experience. Sandwiches slowly came out over the next 15-20 minutes, so we did not all eat at the same time. We were either accidentally given dirty coffee cups or they were not thoroughly washed, as my husband and I had to rinse them before passing on to the guests. Some of the waitstaff tried to be helpful, while others were clearly annoyed.

I wouldn‚Äôt leave a bad review for a small business without understanding the potential repercussions. I want them to do well. It‚Äôs conveniently located in the Botanical Gardens, is aesthetically cute and not a chain cafe. However, I strongly encourage them that until their cafe is prepared to take group orders or reservations, that they remove this option completely from their website. As of today, the menu remains not updated. If someone emails your cafe inquiring about group reservations, consider responding that it‚Äôs not something your cafe currently has the capacity to do. Less disappointment and stress for everyone involved.

Perhaps an ok place to stop in if you are passing by and see they have an open table. Not a place to make group reservations on your wedding day or any other day when organization, following a time schedule, or all guests getting to eat at the same time is important for you.",8 months ago,Gina Mastrianni

I was able to get a new one, but would have preferred to be asked in advance. The strawberry daiquiri was good, as it came from a slush machine.

Food:
I ordered the pizza prosciutto e Burrata. I love burrata, but this was the hardest burrata I have ever had. The consistency was more like a mozarella. The crust was not airy, but dense.

2632,Gangnam Restaurant,4.5,4.0,Not to over rate I did not give it a 5‚≠ê. 4 is not bad really. If they can make the Korean fried chicken less sweet ( it was a bit too sweet really) then maybe I'd give a 5ü§î Uhh a little bit more kimchi please. That's a hallmark of korean cuisine.,a year ago,Aproniana Celades Saether
2633,Gangnam Restaurant,4.5,5.0,"We have ordered the 4 course menu number 2, it came with one Kimchi pancake and one Kimchi and Beef dumpling each as the appetizer. All tasted excellent. As the Entr√©e, we have received a bowl of Topokki in chili sauce, also fantastic. For our main course we had Korean fried chicken and thinly sliced beef stir fry. The fried chicken was crispy and tender although thoroughly marinated in an astonishing sauce. The entrec√¥te was tender and juicy. Since the two dishes shared a plate the spices of both meats and the accompanying vegetables were mixed beautifully and harmonized heavenly. I couldn‚Äôt have wished for a better desert sweet and refreshing the plate was the best possible finish. The green tea ice cream took the heat, of wich there could have been more, away from your tastebuds. The mushy pancake and the sticky rice cake cleansed you mouth of any remaining oils.

Alongside the meal we enjoyed 20cl of Jinro‚Äòs fruit Soju. The only one available at the time was plum, wich in my opinion, having tried all other flavors, is the best. If you‚Äôve never tried Soju before or only drank Lotte Liquor‚Äòs Chum Churum, Jinro‚Äòs Chamisul Fresh, the basis for the fruit version, is way softer and rounder. While Chum Churum is an after dinner drink, Jinro‚Äôs Soju can be enjoyed all throughout. If you‚Äôve never tried Korean Soju before, think of it as a milder yet more tasteful/ rich version of Japanese sake (Sake recommendation: Urakasumi Junmai Misty Bay - is the way to go).

The atmosphere was very calm, with rather unspectacular furniture, the mood was set by some quite K-Pop, such as Ribbon by BamBam, music in the background and several paintings and pictures showcasing Korea, in all it‚Äôs glory. Since all light sources were aimed at the wall the room was well lit but still very soft and diffused.

Regarding the service, it was, as expected very kind, willing to help and accommodating. We were greeted by a nice Korean gentleman. Our food was served by a, non Korean, young Asian gentleman who told us all he could about the foreign Food. As we left I‚Äôve asked for a small Korean lesson and a nice lady came from the kitchen to teach me how to properly say hello and goodbye in Korean. My previous knowledge turned out to be quite wrong.

Continuing with my bad Korean skills:
I would describe this whole experience as, to put it simple, daebak. Wich, as I‚Äôve been told, means awesome. If I wouldn‚Äôt be leaving this city tomorrow I could see myself eating here weekly for the rest of my life.",a year ago,The Crome

We took a simple prosciutto pizza with tomatoes and enjoyed it a lot, I might only want it to be a bit juicier and to have a little bit more greens (arugula) but overall the experience was positive.
It is located in a sort of market hall, so you can get some other beautiful things around too.",2 years ago,–õ—é–¥–º–∏–ª–∞ –•—Ä–∏–∂–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è

The Gym really surprised me, it has 2 barbell racks, 2 rowers ( that work ! ) kettle bells & plenty of free weights.  I‚Äôm so angry I got ill half way through my holiday, I enjoyed 2 days of using it.

Things to improve‚Ä¶

As we learned during our stay in this hotel it‚Äôs used largely for business conferences, me with my family felt at times during lunch  ‚Äú unwanted ‚Äú by particular staff and made to feel we would run of not paying for lunch. ( even though we had our card details to our room )

The cleaner the first time didn‚Äôt really do a great job at first by with a little coaxing she got better.

Heating could be better

Extraction for bathroom would be nice, sometimes could smell a tad slightly.

The bar has so much more potential, they have a brilliantly trained cocktail bartender but a lack of spirits, they should utilise him.

However, the waitress told me to just sit and they will prepare me the food again and I don't have to pay for it, which was good. But at the end of the meal they actually asked me to pay saying that they cancelled the foodora so I will get back my money. I understand I have to pay for the food, but just for the wholeeee inconvenience and THEIR FAULT that they told me to come for nothing, and more than 3 hours waiting time, I was AT LEAST expecting a commercial gesture such as a discount or something.

I've had that pizza at other Domino's locations, where it was juicy and full of BBQ sauce, so this was such a disappointment. Staff forgot to give the advertised discount and had to start over and get help to get it right.

2814,Entrecote by Trancher,4.1,4.0,"We got here late and could only get a table outside. But even though it was very windy, the heaters and the blankets made it fine to dine here.
About the food: well, you can't go wrong if you specialise in only one type of dish. The flavour was all there. Not THE best of my life, but tender and well seasoned. The pimentos padr√≥n were wonderfully done, and the chipotle fries on point. They have the correct amount of spices without it overpowering the flavour of the fries that you expect to taste.

2820,SKAAL Matbar,4.4,2.0,"This place became our favorite after several visits. Although I don‚Äôt live in Oslo anymore, having a meal at Skaal has become a must-do for me every time when I‚Äôm back here. However, our experience this time disappointed us, big time. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore, at least until they change the menu again. The two stars I gave here are even a bit generous, but one of the stars is for the good wine, the other one gives credit to the good job they used to do.

First, the service had been extremely friendly, helpful and passionate before. I could recall the waiters still smiling to everyone and trying to engage with the customers all the time on full-house rush hours. This time though, some of the waitresses had this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t‚Äù kind of attitude ‚Äî sort of rushing us to order, never explained the food in details like they used to do before, and didn‚Äôt even notice that our water bottle was empty. (Please note that we were one of the 4 tables dining at the time) We were shocked that the service style went from maximal attention down to less than minimal. Worst of all, no one ever asked how our food was, which was incredibly strange. We had 6 dishes, which means they had plenty of chances to check on us but they simply didn‚Äôt.

Second, as mentioned above that no one ever cared to ask if the food was good, here‚Äôs an answer: generally awful ‚Äî bear in mind that this is not a cheap eatery. In regard of the pricing, one of the dishes was good, three were ok, two were just edible.

The only good one was the oysters. They managed to buy good quality oysters and opened them without leaving pieces of shells on the flesh, bravo. The clear slightly spicy sauce served with the oysters, which was obviously allegedly a style of ‚Äúleche de tigre‚Äù, was good. Maybe change the name before Peruvians get mad.

The Bolinhos had good flavors, but were cold inside, and had an unpleasant rancid taste probably from the frying oil. Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka. Also because we left the restaurant with disappointment and confusion, and it used to be satisfaction with exceptional food and amazing service a few months ago.",2 months ago,Kinciyang B√∏ng

2931,Pizzeria La Pietra,4.6,5.0,"Even though Neapolitan pizza (high & soft) is all the rage these days, out of the two delicious styles, I actually prefer the Roman style (low & crisp).

So it suits me perfectly that I now have La Pietra in the neighbourhood!

I got the garlic dressing with chilli sauce too. It's the standard mass produced garlic dressing you get everywhere, with no actual garlic flavour, and where the vinegar completely overpowers the flavours of the pizza. So I'd honestly just skip it if I were you, and just enjoy the really good pizza!

It's a very short walk from the beautiful V√•lerenga Park, where you can enjoy your pizza while the sun sets.

Peking duck
Duck is not freshly grilled but rather reheated. Skin is not the crispiest but passable. Sides and pancake are good but what are paprika doing there?",2 weeks ago,D
3003,DimSum by Taste Of China,4.4,2.0,"Lunched there on 25th June 22. Very average or below average dimsums with too thick skins !!. The Xiaolong bao was dry and the waitress told us this is the Cantonese way. I wanted to tell her that I lived in Hong Kong for a few years and have never eaten or heard of Cantonese Xiaolong bao üòÇ. It is either from Mainland or Taiwan and always has soup inside. Also they served deep fried ravioli and samosas and stuff like that before the siumai/ hargaw with overthick coating. Deep fried stuff kinda spoils the appetite for the more delicate dim sums.
Peking duck was good though.
To conclude, if you want to eat dimsum which tastes even remotely like the real thing, then this is probably not the place to be.

Beef tartar ü•©, the absolute best beef tartar we had tasted to date. Meat was tender scraped leg meat, paired perfectly with dijon mustard and sour hints from capers.

Crab from Hitra ü¶Ä, its just a mayo based crab salad with baked celery root. With a hint of sourness in the sauce.

Duck hearts ü¶Ü nice foresty wild flavors with lingon berries. Served medium raw.

Cantarells üçÑ wirh mushroom bulion had a good earthy flavor.

Monkfish üêü was a bit undercooked, but I just consider it an accident as taste and flavor was excellent with white wine sauce and trout roe giving a nice texture.

Hallibut üêü was perfectly fried and was sauce was good with the paprica cream.

Vanilla tarte was the best dessert i had in a while, baked with real vanilla pods and testure and taste was excellent. Raspberry sorbet gives a nice tartiness and a freshness. Recommend.

For the main course we had a very good pasta dish with a delicious tomato sauce, guancale and pecorino cheese. For dessert we settled on a panna cotta, but with a cinnamon sauce, applesauce and roasted almonds. It was incredibly good and a perfect end to a very good meal. Everything tasted lovely.

No doubt they make the best kardamomboller I have ever tasted in Oslo. Go early to get them;)

13.02.2021: So far, I have tasted the best fastelavnsbolle and semlor I have ever tasted in Oslo. Since I have been trying many different versions for the past week, I must say that I can really compare them. Both the one filled with jam and almond paste were amazingly delicious. The dough had enough amount of cardamom (can even be more since I love it!), which finally did not disappoint me because I believe in Norway they do not use much cardamom in the dough for semlor, the cream and jam were very fresh and the almond paste was so good. I wish they would continue making them at least for a day weekly, but tomorrow is your last chance so go get them and go early:)
PS: The sourdough bread with many seeds was heavenly, made a real magical touch to our breakfast. Much thanks to the lady working there who suggested this particular bread.

Although I love spicy food (I live in Sri Lanka for several months each year), I found the kimchee too spicy (not too spicy for me, but for overwhelming the taste of everything else in the dish), and the 2 'spicy' ramens we had - weren't spicy at all (the spicy hazelnut tan tan men is not actually a ramen either).

The broth is not flavourful or balanced, and we have tried 3 different kinds of ramen too. I brought two friends in November and 2 different friends today, and all of them were excited at first but disappointed in the ramen. Not to mention this time we were given so little broth that it was below the noodles...

I hope Hrimnir can recover back to the delicious ramens they used to serve in the beginning, because until then I don't think I will be coming back anymore as it's no longer good. The staff is always friendly though. Don't trust the old positive reviews, it's gone down in quality unfortunately.",a week ago,Jimin Jung

3359,San Francisco Bread Bowl,4.6,5.0,"Service:
Great, no complaints. They let me order the mac N cheese as a side, as opposed to in a bread bowl as they normally serve it. Plus for that.

Food:
I ordered a side of mac N cheese and the Indonesian soup in a bread bowl. When the food came my heart sank a bit when I saw the max and cheese BUT! The taste was there. It's more of a stove top style mac and cheese as opposed to being baked, which is what I'm used to. But it tasted great. Didn't regret it. The soup was also delicious. I thought the bread would be a hard, gum bruiser but alas...it was not. Instead it was soft.

Drinks:
I had a tequila and grapefruit drink...delish. I want to go back just for that drink. Nice amount of tartness to balance the bitterness.

The restaurant:
It's quaint and cozy, with seating outside, in the first floor and a second floor...or sort of indoor balcony for lack of a better description. The furniture upstairs where I sat was low tables and sofas. So much better if you're just drinking. Not that comfortable when eating. You also run a much higher risk of getting soup on yourself.

Note: Currently, they only have two types of filter coffee. I remember the first one, which we tried, has fruity flavours and a smooth drinking.

Absolutely incredible food.",7 months ago,Martin Lindgren
3486,Restaurant Jyun,4.5,3.0,"We decided to dine here after hearing great things about the food, but were a bit surprised when we received the menu. A lot of the items that were pictured in other reviews were no longer available with practically only dim sum, sushi and tasting menus remaining. Although a bit put off, we still decided to pull through and ordered four portions of the tasting menu priced at kr. 598 per person (7 dishes).

1. Laks cream cheese*
My personal favorite. Rich cream cheese that blends perfectly with the salmon. Topped with a well-paired sauce.

2-3. Har Gow & Hoi Sin Gow
Steamed dumplings, one portion with scampi and one portion with chinese chives. Tastes as expected. Good, but nothing special.

4. Gyoza
Regular dumpling. Tastes as expected. Good, but nothing special.

5. Friterte Biffrulle*
Fried beef roll. Taste is good, but is a bit on the greasy side. Also quite salty.

6. Kantonesisk Roast And*
Duck was great. Soft meat and crispy skin. Comes with steamed broccoli soaked in duck fat (salty). Previous reviews have shown this dish served with a portion of rice which was exactly what we thought was missing.

7. Dessert (rice chips; warm banana pie; vanilla ice cream)
Yummy dessert. Classic fried banana in the shape of a dumpling, which was cool, paired with vanilla ice cream. Great presentation.

Atmosphere / service
Friendly service and nice atmosphere. Great attention to detail in terms of decor, plating and utensils.

Price
A bit expensive. If you're eating for hunger you're probably going to have to order sushi unless you want to shell out ~4-700 NOK (2-3 dim sum or a menu, not including drinks).

Overall
Decent food. None of the dishes tasted bad per-se, but you would expect better when paying close to 600 NOK. None of us left the restaurant particularly full. Visit for the atmosphere. All in all a 3/5.",11 months ago,Jan

The food itself was good, very good for the price, but not terribly exciting.

We entered the unmarked establishment (save a small poster on the side door entrance) and were immediately impressed by the strong authentic Japanese feel of the bar. In short, it was like a bar was magically teleported from the streets of Shinjuko into downtown Oslo.

The bar featured a variety of Japanese beer, (including a porter and an IPA) and even had Kirin on draught. We ordered Cucuumber Kimchi, Gyoza, Edamame. The Gyoza, in my opinion, was above average and clearly made fresh. The dessert was fantastic!

3559,Anatolia,4.3,5.0,"Had a really great lunch here with my bf after hunting down the amazing street art in the local area. We both had the Lamb Tirit from the Turkish specialties part of the menu, a dish I've never tried or even seen on a menu before. We both agreed it was utterly delicious! The meat was succulent and perfectly spiced, and the bread beneath it had soaked up all the juices and the rich tomato and yogurt sauce. Good sized portion too. It came with bulgar, tzatziki and salad. For dessert I had another traditional dish I've never tried but have seen in the UK: kunefe and vanilla ice-cream. I had imagined the soft cheese in the description to be a cream cheese, but it was in fact a harder cheese that had melted in the cooking process, and that, combined with the shredded wheat, the syrup and the icecream made for a really different, but tasty, experience. We paid just under ¬£50 for the 2 mains, the dessert, a Turkish tea, a Turkish coffee and a soft drink - a bargain by Oslo's standards. A special mention has to go to the restroom. Very spacious and uniquely decorated, and very clean!",2 years ago,Rebecca B

We ordered ox tail croquetes with curiosity, I am Spanish so usually unless you are in Sapin they taste quite bland compared with traditional ones (filled with potatoes) but this ones were proper ones! were so good that we have to order another round, and the chef Guido came to check on us, he was so lovely and attentive! He arrived with some special Spanish sauces off the menu, very delicious. We also ordered a some parpadelle,, entrec√¥te and cod, it was outstanding! Good portions, well flavoured, very fresh product. And the deserts were to die for. This place is not close to the city center, but is not far either, it definitely is worth to go.

Now it‚Äôs packed with alcoholics and service has become worse - same as the food. It seems that it has taken over as the ‚Äúlocal brown pub‚Äù.

Today I ordered the biff galangal with nuddles; the dish was full with sticky noodles that was not able to be pulled apart.

3761,Scandic Holmenkollen Park Hotel,4.2,4.0,"We stayed for a conference at this Hotel, and did enjoy our stay. We upgraded to a Superior Suite (which is cheaper than booking it online) and this gave us rooms on the 3rd floor with views towards the city and sea.

My room 3236 was nice, though under the bed it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned in ages and the light in the shower can‚Äôt be turned off - for a Hotel chain which writes ‚ÄúSustainability‚Äù everywhere this is quite bad, as is changing towels which have been used once and hadn‚Äôt been indicated to be changed.

The handle of the big window was broken too and the window couldn‚Äôt be locked. Besides these few things I liked the room and slept great on the hard mattress!

Breakfast was superb, I like the wide variety of vegan/ vegetarian options. The dinner we ate in the Restaurant was good, though it took a long time to receive the food. Service in the Restaurant was friendly but not fast. They definitely should hire more staff.

All in all I would stay here again, as I like the possibility to go walking in nature far away from the bustle of the city.",5 months ago,Hendrik Morkel
3762,Scandic Holmenkollen Park Hotel,4.2,2.0,"Our stay was a little over a month after the hotel reopened after renovation. However renovation is still going on as there were workers all over the place. The parking garage was practically filled with worker trucks. There was no gym / fitness center as this is still under construction. The room was supposedly a superior one but the design is very poor. No place to open large suitcases and they don't have luggage racks. The bathroom although modern looking was really poor. There is a step down which is quite a safety tripping hazard. There were only two hooks for hanging things and they were located right behind where the towels are hanging. The shower puts water all over the floor where water is not supposed to be and the hotel does not have floor towels. Also there was no telephone in the room and when we notified them of this nothing was done about it. The view from the room was great but I cannot recommend staying at this hotel. Dining at the restaurant took a very long time as they were short staffed. This hotel is a beautiful facility in a beautiful location and I am not generally a complainer, but our stay was quite disappointing.",5 months ago,Loyal Schreiber

I love Biryani so without hesitation I ordered chicken biryani. I had 3 hit options. Mild, Medium & Strong. I asked for the strong. I received my order in time, on a brass vessel placed on top of a metal sizzler. The cutlery was placed on the very hot sizzler and was pretty hot üî•.
I couldn't call it a Biryani at all. It was more like a pulao. It had Green & Red peppers, as well as Pomegranates in it. Mint leaves and Barista (Fried onions) we're missing.

1) It costs around 170 nok for four shrimps. Nothing else. Seriously??? The shrimps were tasteless. The sauce was very salty!
2) The table was very dirty and sticky. When the customs on our neighbor‚Äôs table left,  the waiter did NOT wipe the table!
3) We waited for 30 mins for the main dishes.
4) They have enough tables upstairs, but they would rather give customs the table near the toilet and loud entry instead!

What really takes down your experience is the uncomfortable interior decoration (hard chairs and very little space between tables) as well as the badly trained waiters. They have no idea of proper serving etiquette multiple times the waiter will reach in front of you to grab things and then stack all the empty plate in front of you on top of the table before taking them away.

And while I understand the rush waiters have especially in days with a full restaurant. It would be nice if they could stop to answer questions about the food or check if anything is needed in the table.

Good sides: the waitress was really good! She was attentive and her wine selection for us was very accurate! The atmosphere is nice. The amount of food is good, the variation of the selected dishes in the tasting menu is good.
Not so good sides: the wine menu looked a bit overpriced. At least compared to the sophistication level of the dishes. Some of the dishes lacked taste and some of them were just giving a junk food feel with the garnitures and the sauces in them. The average bottle price of a wine is around 2500kr there and I cannot imagine pairing such expensive wine with some of these dishes. So I think there is some room for improvement for developing some of their dishes. The wine list is very large and I am definitely not expert on all of these wines but I can normally easily select a wine type that I would like. Here it was impossible because whatever grape I chose, the bottle price was nothing less than 2000kr. I saw couple of cheaper options around 600kr but I didn‚Äôt know those wines. So we decided to go for by glass option since we also couldn‚Äôt agree what type of wine we would drink. Menu doesn‚Äôt contain the by glass options. So you have to go and read the blackboard on the wall to select a wine. This is not easy, it‚Äôs not written in a nice order which makes it a long and difficult task. So we just trusted the waitress and she did an excellent job. We don‚Äôt know how much each glass was costing but the bill wasn‚Äôt heavy at the end. So I guess she was able to serve us delicious wine for reasonable price :) I think we would like to go there again but not for the full menu. Some selected dishes and some good wine by the glass. Another note: the window seats at the front is actually a good idea but it‚Äôs freezing there. Some heating would be good :)",a year ago,Pelin Smines

Fantastic cosy cafe conveniently located right next to Majorstuen T-Bane station. The vibe is great, the cakes are top quality and so is the hot chocolate with whipped cream!

4172,Kanpai Sushi x Izakaya,4.6,4.0,"Pros: The food was excellent! We ordered the Wagyu yaki, the Iberico yaki, the ribs, the lamb chops, and the Katsu soba. The Iberico yaki and ribs were phenomenal, they are might be even better than the Wagyu, to be honest! The charcoal does make everything taste so much better. I also really love the sweet potato puree, the pastinakk krem and the cabbage pickles that served with the dishes.
The waitress who served was extremely nice (the asian girl who can't speak Norwegian). She was very friendly.

Cons: On the other hand, there was a male server (long hair) who was a bit unfriendly. He made us feel a bit unwelcomed when we first arrive at the restaurant and was not very service-minded.
The Katsu soba was ok, but not very special. The truffle cream even though tasted very good on its own, it did not go well with the chicken katsu cutlet - it made the chicken taste so rich and easy to get tired off. I also would rather my veggies be cooked a bit more done.
Aside from the good sides I mentioned above, some sides were not that good. The grilled padron pepper was very bitter (I expected chili peppers to be sweet and have some heat), and it did not go well with the Iberico. The Daikon pickles were unevenly cut thus there were some very thick pieces that were not properly pickled and had an unpleasant raw taste. The grilled broccolini was good, however, if you are going to serve the end stem, you should peel the outside a bit since those tend to be very fibrous and unpleasant to eat.
One biggest letdown was the wooden 1-time-use chopsticks! I have expected some decent chopsticks when dining out in a fancy restaurant. I did not expect to see those cheap ones you can get at a corner/kiosk sushi store. They were very unpleasant to use as they were shorter and smaller than our usual size of home chopsticks. Also, if you are gonna serve dishes which have pieces of meat and puree, you should provide a knife and fork automatically as it is impossible to eat those kinds of food with just chopsticks (how can one eat puree and cut meat with chopsticks, this is coming from a Vietnamese who have used chopsticks forever).

Overall, it was a good night! I love the food so much so I will definitely come back.",11 months ago,Ngan Huynh Bao

My last night in Oslo and I wanted to treat myself to something different - and I got it.
No menu! You don't choose your food, but instead get invited to a 10 course dinner of various foods , selected by the chef. The dishes are small of course and vary from sashimi to beef. (See photos). So much going on with each dish, very refined and very tasty. They serve you very nice accompanying wine as well.

It's a small establishment and very laid back. Loved the environment and choice of music, which reminded me more of a bar than a restaurant. In fact it was like a cocktail bar, but for food. Right up my street.
It's not on the cheap side though, but what is in Oslo.

I was also taken care of very well by the very friendly and attentive staff/waiters. Thanks guys!

Good Peking duck but missed the proper crispy skin and the sauce was way too sweet.

The gung bao chicken had the wrong vegetables; string beans, broccoli, squash and lotus flower. Cashew instead of peanuts.

Stir fried spicy lamb was not bad. Tender lamb meat but unexciting taste overall.

Their fusion fried dimsum was dry and needed more dipping sauce.

The east European manager there, she barely know how to make a burger.

I got a lettuce wrapped burger but the cheese wasn't even melt the meat was cold. I asked could they please melt the cheese, it seems nothing was ready?
- The manager said she can't melt it and it serve ""fresh"" as it is, and then asked me to warm it up on microwave!!!????

So basically you go to Max burger is like eating cold burger when everything took out ""freshly"" from the freezer, cheese and meat shouldn't be warm or else it isn't ""fresh"" anymore???

I have been eating at Max burger since the 1st restaurant  been opened in Oslo, and my favourite is lettuce wrapped ever since in Sweden.
But never ever been treated so unwelcome and rude like this in my life!

We had Klimataria Grill Mix for (at least) two persons. I would recommend it easily for 3! Souvlaki, Gyros, burger type minced meat, cutlets, fries, thin bread, diverse salads, garnishes, cheese...

The best thing of all, every kind of meat was seasoned slightly different, so you don't get impression you eat the same thing. None of that ""Kebab"" seasoning that gets overused everywhere in Norway, in everything, Bolognese sauce amongst all other things.

I like sitting in, as the interior is really casual and clean, with comfy seats.

I love that they use high quality Stange chicken & beef from Str√∏m-Larsen. Chorizo burger has a lot of flavour, but the chilli might be even tastier with it's awesome sauce.

Quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Comfortably low music volume.üëçüé∂
Toast is served until 15:00 as a lunch special. Wraps, burgers & all sides are served all day, but on Fridays and Saturdays there is a smaller night menu from midnight until 03:30 (last order is 03:15, only for take-away).
Night menu on weekends is a choice of 4 burgers, with or without the menu (which is potatoe wedges, either a bottled drink or freshly pressed orange juice & 2 dips: aioli + BBQ.)

I say this as a Korean-American who spent the last 5 years in San Francisco, and has eaten copious amounts of Asian food in Korea, Japan, China, and at home.

I would like to write a disclaimer that this does not include Vietnamese food. Vietnamese are the 4th largest immigrant population in Norway, so there seems to be a wealth of Vietnamese food around Oslo. Therefore, I think it deserves a category of its own.

1. I can see and feel the care that the women and men put into their dishes
2. They have a small menu and everything on their menu has a reason for being there
3. They have wifi, so if you need to grab a meal and get stuff done, you can do both
4. There is a lot of seating; you'll see once you walk in, there's a larger area inside
5. It's a great place to grab dinner with a group of friends at the end of the week
6. They serve beer and cider for all those who want to loosen up a bit
7. Very reasonably priced with good portions, so if you and your friend aren't that hungry, you can easily share a rice or noodle dish as a snack
8. Admittedly, the ambience could be a little more lively with some music, but easily a place you can fill with the laughter of you and your friends

Totally recommend as starters
‚ù§Ô∏è spicy tuna tatar
‚ù§Ô∏èmojito shashimi
Sushis
‚ù§Ô∏èspicy salmon roll (crispy and creamy)
‚ù§Ô∏èwagyu tataki
‚ù§Ô∏èduck deluxe (foie gras &  flamed duck just melts in your mouth)
‚ù§Ô∏èroyal roll maki
Meat
‚ù§Ô∏ètiger scampi ( prawns not overcooked with crispy flamed exploding flavours)

‚ù§Ô∏è they r known for crispy duck so far the best i had tasted in town! Crispy and juicy duck and moist thin pancakes, lots of diff side veggies eg: mango and raddish which usually not in usual duck pancakes but they surprisingly taste soooo good all together.

‚ù§Ô∏èdessert pandan creme brule is super unique as pandan makes it super fragrant with creamy and crispy sugar crisp on top. Something i cant find in asia

4403,Tatakii Asian,4.3,5.0,"This was a very good experience. Everything was as good or better than expected, including the food taste and quantity and the excellent service. The spicier dishes had a bit much of that rough and dry Asian sting I'm not too crazy about, but that's not their fault, it's standard and most people seem to like it. Wine prices were crazy but that's also standard in Oslo. In contrast, the set menu prices were quite reasonable if not downright affordable by Oslo standards. Also the place was not too noisy despite being full. All in all, a very good choice.",a month ago,Athanassios Protopapas
4404,Tatakii Asian,4.3,5.0,"We came on a late afternoon on Sunday and had not booked a table beforehand. We were greeted very quickly after entering and were offered to hang our coates in the cloakroom, very convenient for when its cold outside.

We found the staff to be very polite, they described the dishes, briefly how it was made and made recommendation of how to eat the dishes to reflect the chef's original idea of tastes. We loved it, thank you for that!

Atmosphere was very nice and cosy.
Prices are as you expect for Oslo, so no surprise, but for the service the peices are well worth the experience.

First appetizer with salmon salad and tuna tartar tasted delicious! Second serving was dumplings and spring rolls, also very flavorful with a spicy punch. One main course was roasted duck with pancakes, the hoisin souce was a bit dull and the vegetables were dried out. Pancakes were so sticky that we had difficulties separating them. The meal was followed up with chewy and fatty lamb chops(really disappointing), a spicy beef dish and a seafood dish. Desert was on point with chocolate mousse topped with a fruity ice cream and berries.

Great place for a date or special celebration.
The tableware and the size of the portions yell posh, yet everybody who works there treats you like you were a guest in their house. This creates a unique atmosphere were you feel safe and taken care of. What adds to that experience is the fact that there is no menu. You tell the staff your preferences and trust the process.

The food was absolutely delicious, taste combinations fused well together even though you could still distinguish the distinct flavours of the ingredients. I appreciated that everything was explained to us in detail so we knew what we were eating and where the produce came from.

When the bill came, we were positively surprised. For that quality of food, I expected to pay much more.

Nice cozy place.
Their pasta dish was awesome!
Their pizza was awesome!
The manager is talkative!

CONS:
The pancakes...crepes....were tasteless and awfull. The first ones i got were hard as the plate themselves and overfried and dark and tasteless. I complained when manager asked and he got me a new one. Pretty perfectly fried this time but still tasteless. I make better pancakes myself. Tip!: For pancakes you need butter, sugar and lots of eggs and rich milk.

Service is not really anything here. You can find yourself waiting for forever without the manager who is also the server...and sometimes the chef makes contact. Most of the time you need to go hail him from behind the kitchen.

If you have a place like this, you need a dedicated Server. You can't do it all alone.

Your customers are your business, and paying attention to their needs is why you are there as server.

I really like the place, but do not blame the new chef for not knowing how to make pancakes. Don't put him to work unless he can consistently make all dishes you serve in the establishment. ...pancakes are not hard to make....you put a thin layer, wait until the edges go brown, put another piece of butter on before flipping it. Give it 30 seconds and remove it. Finish! Perfect every time.

4583,Tiki sushi,4.2,3.0,"Just had the sushi, so can't speak for anything else on the menu. The sushi is relatively standard stuff from this part of the world. It tastes ok I guess, but it didn't really taste very fresh. The salmon was OK, but the tuna felt like it had been lying a while, and the hamachi tasted ok, but had a funky color. The rice of some of the pieces was a bit mushy, which kind of dragged down the total impression of everything. It's fine, but not great by any stretch.

4587,Tiki sushi,4.2,2.0,"Ordered dumplings with beef, Vietnamese spring rolls, gong bao with beef, chop suey with beef and duck. Dumplings: All right, mild in taste, the sauce that came with it was like diluted soy sauce. Lack of depth. Spring rolls: the filling lacked flavor, the roll itself tasted most like the oil should have been changed. Gong bao: Good crispy vegetables, but thin sauce with too much acid that was more reminiscent of tabasco. Chop suey: really hope I got it wrong right here; the sauce was thin and tasted exclusively of lemongrass and way too much pepper. Duck: sauce I did not get, and the meat was so dry that it must have been heated long after frying.
Received email about 55 minutes waiting time for food. Came to pick it up after 40 minutes and then the food was ready. No update on the order was given along the way, and I then wonder how cold the food had been had I arrived after the 55 I was first given.",10 months ago,Andrea S√¶thern

4629,SKAAL Matbar,4.4,2.0,"This place became our favorite after several visits. Although I don‚Äôt live in Oslo anymore, having a meal at Skaal has become a must-do for me every time when I‚Äôm back here. However, our experience this time disappointed us, big time. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore, at least until they change the menu again. The two stars I gave here are even a bit generous, but one of the stars is for the good wine, the other one gives credit to the good job they used to do.

First, the service had been extremely friendly, helpful and passionate before. I could recall the waiters still smiling to everyone and trying to engage with the customers all the time on full-house rush hours. This time though, some of the waitresses had this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t‚Äù kind of attitude ‚Äî sort of rushing us to order, never explained the food in details like they used to do before, and didn‚Äôt even notice that our water bottle was empty. (Please note that we were one of the 4 tables dining at the time) We were shocked that the service style went from maximal attention down to less than minimal. Worst of all, no one ever asked how our food was, which was incredibly strange. We had 6 dishes, which means they had plenty of chances to check on us but they simply didn‚Äôt.

Second, as mentioned above that no one ever cared to ask if the food was good, here‚Äôs an answer: generally awful ‚Äî bear in mind that this is not a cheap eatery. In regard of the pricing, one of the dishes was good, three were ok, two were just edible.

The only good one was the oysters. They managed to buy good quality oysters and opened them without leaving pieces of shells on the flesh, bravo. The clear slightly spicy sauce served with the oysters, which was obviously allegedly a style of ‚Äúleche de tigre‚Äù, was good. Maybe change the name before Peruvians get mad.

The Bolinhos had good flavors, but were cold inside, and had an unpleasant rancid taste probably from the frying oil. Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka. Also because we left the restaurant with disappointment and confusion, and it used to be satisfaction with exceptional food and amazing service a few months ago.",2 months ago,Kinciyang B√∏ng

Elevator was not working, which we weren‚Äôt told in advance, though it looked like, it had been like that for a while.
The main reason for giving only three stars was the shower, which was either boiling or very cold. I actually burned myself.
My friend on the same floor had the same problem, and I see that other reviews are mentioning the same, so it should have been fixed!
Although only staying for 2 nights I had two new towels on the 2nd day, which was not very eco friendly.

4664,Mozhgan Zafar,3.7,5.0,"Dr. Zafar is an amazing Doctor.  She is very caring and her bedside manner is like no other.  The way healthcare is set up now, Dr. Zafar‚Äôs previous private practice now falls under the Eastside Medical umbrella.  I looked at all the negative reviews in here and they clearly were left from newer patients after the merger.  The customer service of Eastside as a whole should not be a poor reflection on Dr. Zafar who is an amazing doctor!   The staff that were hired by Dr Zafar prior to this merger were exceptional, kind, understanding and professional.  In fact , Phyllis who is an exceptional Physician Assistant is still with Dr Zafar.  Dr Zafar is the type of doctor who looks out for the patient and what‚Äôs best for their health.  If you want a doctor who just writes prescriptions or you tell her what you want despite protocol, that is not the professional doctor she is.  She truly cares for her patient‚Äôs well-being!  Also, since there are many doctors who merged under the umbrella of Eastside Medical, the staff people complained about in previous reviews most likely are not the staff that Dr. Zafar chose for the office.  Dr.  Zafar is amazing.  Both my husband and I love the services she offers to her patients.  She is so good that a lot of the time she is also scheduled months out.  She is definitely worth being proactive and scheduling in advance, if you can.  I also just called and was offered an appt for either today or tomorrow‚Äînot a long wait at all.

I am a fairly healthy person who does not frequent the doctor other than a routine physical but, the two  times I get sick in a year and call her office I am told by her front office staff that she is booked solid for the next 3 months. The person I spoke to advised me to call in the morning to see if she has any cancellations for the day but I am a working individual. Her schedule caters to more retired individuals not working people. So if if you work this is not the doctor's office for you. The other thing is they do not send reminders about annual testing. Thi is huge because this is all of the preventive maintenance stuff and you will have to remember to call and request they schedule it for you.

4738,Pokalen Aker Brygge,3.7,4.0,"Hmm - mixed feelings because I went there a few times this weekend to watch football, which I saw. So mission accomplished there. Screens all around- the main large one is blocked by the stage and therefore band equipment (I moved it- perhaps I shouldn't have). All the other screens are either too high to see from infront of or just a little small to see from the opposite side.. but still fine. It was empty when we first went, and I mean, we were the only 3 people in there- ordering food, I was a little sceptical as reviews are sketchy at best, but was assured that the staff know that and as the kitchen had just started and the chefs were waiting for their first order, that we'd be ok - that they were on it. First, the burger and chips - all cooked well with nice ingredients (although one friend said it was just ok), I thought it was really good, including the nicely crisped chips. Second, some truffle pasta dish, which my other friend thought was delicious - I have since disowned him as the pasta was hugely overcooked and sloppy (as seen in pic), although tasty (because cheese and truffles are tasty), was more like a truffle risotto. Some mix ups the next day too with certain screens being turned over in the middle of matches, and I ordered a fried chicken side, to be told that they didn't have chicken, did I want a chicken Cesar salad instead! Different chicken was the answer, but turns out they did have the fried chicken, and it came out almost 1 minute later, and actually was very nice",4 months ago,Marc Berry

4748,Brasserie France,4.6,5.0,"Petit Paris

The name gave me high expectations. We love Paris and we‚Äôre very curious about the food and the feel (very important!).

The expectations came through completely. It actually felt like we were on a terrace in Paris. Only the waiter spoke perfectly English and was very friendly and helpful. More and more we experience that in Paris too, but waiters can be rude in Paris.

Not at Brasserie France in Oslo. Waiter and waitress are very very forthcoming and polite. I love restaurants with this modus operandi. Old fashion, but this will become modern. The coffeebar-order-and-payand-wait-and-get-it-yourself needs to be banned out of this world. And it will. It‚Äôs irritating.

The menu at Brasserie France is French (no surprise there), the look and feel are French as well. We were really pleased with the croque monsieur and madam that tasted exactly the same as in Paris (or anywhere in France for that matter), so it felt double like a holiday. The quality was excellent, especially the fries were the best.

Wooden floors and mismatched furniture gives it an overall homey feel. Waiting time for the food was nothing out of the ordinary. About 20 minutes or so.

This sandwich inspired me to create my own sour dough starter. The bread is THAT good. Like a thick slice of sour dough pillowy goodness topped with goat's cheese, brussel sprouts and anchovies. I have since bought sour dough and recreated this at home. I'm not sure as to how the brussel sprouts are prepared but there's a bit of crunch to them but they're not raw.
The dip and vegetables were also a nice addition to the meal. This meal is great as a lunch and you can add on more things from the menu to make it brunch.

We paired the meal with a forest brew made from fir shoots, lemongrass and yarrow. Very interesting combination. The flavour was earthy and reminiscent of kombucha/beer/bubbly wine. It was not as earthy as I expected from the description. I think the lemongrass really lifts the overall flavour, making it light.

The ""spicy slaw"" was onion and carrot forward, with little spice.

The green spicy sauce that came with it was a horseradish/wasabi type of spicy, which is polar opposite of what you get with American fried chicken. Heat should come from peppers, with a vinegar main flavor. This was fine, but a little unexpected.

Sweet potatoes were good.
Sadly the coleslaw was really a big disappointment... it almost didn't have any dressing, at least you couldn't taste and too much parsley, overpowered the rest of the slaw's flavor.
And not to forget the burger...  Was not great at all... Bun was dry,not suitable for a chicken burger and by no means was it an american style bun, also not to forget it had mustard inside, which at least for my personal taste , it didn't go well with the burger in question.

'Ello chaps! Return trip a few years later to a hip ""Southern American"" restaurant in the artsy district of Oslo, a short bus ride (or even walk) from downtown.

As someone from the southern United States, where folks are judged on their fried chicken and BBQ, Lucky Bird hits it out of the park. Simply some of the BEST fried chicken I've ever had -- ANY WHERE. The chicken was perfectly moist, and the breading was crispy without feeling heavy or overly oily. The creamed corn and mashed potatoes were top notch. The only complaint about Lucky Bird is that there weren't more locations around Oslo. This is certainly a gem hiding in plain site.

On the return trip the fried chicken was still living up to the standard. Delicious.

Overall the sides can really put a dent in your wallet, so you want to be careful with your order. Oh, and the tea - don't order it if you're expecting a traditional southern American sweet tea. Their tea is not that. It's a mix of tea and lemonade it tasted like.

This was also one of the few restaurants in Norway we found to have full service (meaning a server took your order)

I understand that cross contamination can be difficult when you use the same tools, even though generally, a good wash and some care is all it takes. But this is not traces, and if this can happen to such a degree on items that are, and I quote, ""nut and almond free"", then it points to zero real effort towards avoiding contamination with actual full sized pieces of nuts/almonds, and no one with allergies towards these (and other food items) should feel comfortable eating here.

Drunken noodles are straight up American Chinese style noodles aka lo mein. Noodles are yellow egg noodles and not rice noodles, no Chinese broccoli, basil...and when did drunken noodles have big round slices of carrots? It‚Äôs basically a whole other dish with a misnomer. Not sure how they got away with serving lo mein as drunken noodles for this long?

Coconut curry soup was great but the portion was so small it was basically 40% of the bowl it came in. It‚Äôs almost as if someone had drank from it first before it arrived at the table. Duck was decent.

Lastly, it‚Äôs more of a to go place and not really a sit down restaurant. Pics made the interior look much bigger than it seemed. Service was counter and not really at table unless ordered through the QR code. The ladies working there were really nice though! No complaints about that at all.

Wouldn‚Äôt return unless you‚Äôre real desperate for ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù food but then you could search ‚ÄúAsian restaurants‚Äù, literally close your eyes, point your finger on google maps and go anywhere else.

We only stayed because it was such a nice summer evening and we did not want to get up and find another place. When we finally left, they made us pay for two drinks that the party before us had ordered and not paid for. They said we were together and should have ordered separate bills.

5006,Eff Eff Oyster and Wine Bar,4.5,1.0,"We went to Eff Eff last night around 10pm and around 2am my boyfriend started puking and puked until 11 this morning. Worst food poisining I've experienced.  He had the French and Norwegian oysters, I stuck with the sardines myself (thank god). I was hesitant to eat Oysters before this but now I'll definitely never have it. Especially not at Eff Eff..

I cannot express how EXTREMELY poor I think this is given that this place is supposed to be specialized in oysters and dont serve barely anything else on the menu. It's a hygiene factor for any restaurant of course to serve good oysters, but it's extra shameful when a hyped place that boasts and brands itself around quality oysters then serves contaminated ones. That if any place is where you should feel safe to eat it. Ugghh..

Luckily I didn't have any myself - which is also why I'm sure the food poisoning came from there (because all other meals we have both been eating the same thing).

And to round off this review,  I'm sorry to say that the service was also mediocre. We ordered all our food before a big company and still got served after they got their food. Quite frustrating when you even have to pay 45kr for bread & butter (greedy in my opinion?) yet need to ask about it because it takes so long to be served. All while watching others that ordered later than yourself get served. Get your orders - and your oysters(!!) -in order girls.

I like they don't have any fusion dishes or food ""westerners might like"", but rather focus on making real dumplings and noodles.

Only minus was that you are asked to order with QR code and mobile phone. Probably some leftover after Covid üòÖ But if you ask nicely, you will be allowed to order at the counter (which I think is much nicer).",7 months ago,Daniel Gundersen
5033,Kinabolle Gr√∏nland,4.4,5.0,"This is one of my two favorite Asian restaurants in Oslo, and I recommend you try the 1) hand-pulled noodles, 2) handmade dumplings, and the 3) sweet and spicy chicken. The noodles are chewy and fatty flavor bombs, and the dumplings and the sauce are a juicy reminder of food back at home. I say this as a Korean-American who spent the last 5 years in San Francisco, and has eaten copious amounts of Asian food in Korea, Japan, China, and at home.

I would like to write a disclaimer that this does not include Vietnamese food. Vietnamese are the 4th largest immigrant population in Norway, so there seems to be a wealth of Vietnamese food around Oslo. Therefore, I think it deserves a category of its own.

If you love reading reviews as much as I like writing them, the following is for you:

1. I can see and feel the care that the women and men put into their dishes
2. They have a small menu and everything on their menu has a reason for being there
3. They have wifi, so if you need to grab a meal and get stuff done, you can do both
4. There is a lot of seating; you'll see once you walk in, there's a larger area inside
5. It's a great place to grab dinner with a group of friends at the end of the week
6. They serve beer and cider for all those who want to loosen up a bit
7. Very reasonably priced with good portions, so if you and your friend aren't that hungry, you can easily share a rice or noodle dish as a snack
8. Admittedly, the ambience could be a little more lively with some music, but easily a place you can fill with the laughter of you and your friends

Today, we came back again after 2 days.  The food was very different and had an awful experience.

Two of our main orders were red thai curry (vegetarian) and Pad Thai noodles. We all know Red thai curry is taken with rice, but they made both the dishes with noodles and gave us 2 portions of rice.
Dont know why they made both dishes similar and heavily filled with noodles.

Even after complaining to the staff, that Red Thai curry doesn't usually come with noodles (and also we advised no tofu in Red Thai curry, which they ignored and came heavily loaded with tofus), the waitress simply said that's how it is made.

That was quite rude and you will see the last picture - the bill was paid in full with the portion of Red Thai just like odered new!

And I'm also very satisfied with the sourdough bread I bought, it's absolutely perfect. Even without toasting, it still tastes delicious.
Note: Currently, they only have two types of filter coffee. I remember the first one, which we tried, has fruity flavours and a smooth drinking.

Then ordered two bun cha hanoi and two bun bo hue (spicy pho), the food came and we really love it. The bun cha hanoi reminded me of the bun cha I ate in Hanoi before, it tastes very authentic!

The service was great, or at least our server was very informative and attentive and engaging in helping us having a good dining experience. Drinks were also great!
However, the food was not that great. We bought the tickets to the 13-course Sunday Tasting and we concluded that the main problem of the food was the lack of balance. We informed the kitchen that we are very sensitive to overly salted food and they were trying their best to accompanied that. The first serving was great, which consisted of 4 different small bites/snacks. The watermelon tart was the best, and honestly, that is the only single bite that we thought was good and delivered in flavour. The dinner was just going downhill from there. The next serving are the appetizer or mellomrett. We started with a cold, rich seafood broth with mascarpone mousse. It was good but the broth was so condensed with seafood which make it naturally salty and hard to enjoy. The fried scallops were mediocre - the pickled fennel was actually better than the scallops themselves. The burrata tomato salad was very refreshing - great, sweet tomato and creamy burrata. And then a cauliflower dish - both of us were puzzled what exactly it role was because it was very unremarkable. The problem of unbalance started appearing from this serving - all 4 dishes were TOO rich, with excessive amount of cream and fat in total. We were almost full and lost most of our appetite after this serving, which was ridiculous because they were suppose to be appetizer. Then come our main dishes, which we disappointed the most. First was the porchetta, which was inedible for us because it was ridiculously salty. We informed the server and she made her best effort to make replacement. But the kitchen informed that there were no other meat dish to substitute (which is ridiculous because they serve meatballs and chicken on their normal menu everyday and it's not like everyone coming on Sunday will have a Sunday Tasting menu). So they gave us asparagus with beurre blanc sauce. The other mains are a homemade pasta dish - which was again covered in cream and cheese and was very hard to eat when it got cold, a risotto with truffle and cream and cheese (again) - the rice grain was a bit weird and it stick to our teeth constantly, and finally a mini corn dish with confit garlic sauce, which was the only thing we could finish in this serving. Everything was just cream and cheese, too much fat without anything to cut through so it was extremely hard to enjoy the food. The dessert was an olive cake with balsamic vinegar and strawberry compote, served with ice cream. The ice cream is great, I did not think the balsamic vinegar component worked but my sister liked it.

Overall, it was not a good dinner and definitely not worth the money - we paid NOK 1000 for a dinner for two (food only) but what we got was mostly vegetarian dishes. The food was unbalance, and for us, food is the only reason we will ever come back to a restaurant. Thus, unfortunately, we will not come back.",6 months ago,Ngan Huynh Bao

Beef tartar ü•©, the absolute best beef tartar we had tasted to date. Meat was tender scraped leg meat, paired perfectly with dijon mustard and sour hints from capers.

Crab from Hitra ü¶Ä, its just a mayo based crab salad with baked celery root. With a hint of sourness in the sauce.

Duck hearts ü¶Ü nice foresty wild flavors with lingon berries. Served medium raw.

Cantarells üçÑ wirh mushroom bulion had a good earthy flavor.

Monkfish üêü was a bit undercooked, but I just consider it an accident as taste and flavor was excellent with white wine sauce and trout roe giving a nice texture.

Hallibut üêü was perfectly fried and was sauce was good with the paprica cream.

Vanilla tarte was the best dessert i had in a while, baked with real vanilla pods and testure and taste was excellent. Raspberry sorbet gives a nice tartiness and a freshness. Recommend.

We had a bottle of the house white - Sauvignon blanc 490kr/bottle, watered down, no character and just some floral taste. The Aperol Spritz 125kr was decent with good amount of alcohol. As for the food, we had the regular mussels (with bread) 225kr and moules frites (with fries) 245kr, they were cooked in simple white wine, cream, garlic and onion broth, very basic flavor. The mussels were fresh and juicy with mixture of sizes but not big. In addition, we had the pickled herrings with salads as side 220kr, a perfect appetizer and summer dish.

For dessert we settled on a panna cotta, but with a cinnamon sauce, applesauce and roasted almonds. It was incredibly good and a perfect end to a very good meal. Everything tasted lovely.

The philippino cooks could do with more training, and the prices were hidden from view. one sign said 199,- for the buffet, another 249,- we ordered some beers, the price for these was also not displayed, and as a result we paid restaurant money for a less-than restaurant experience. the service was non-existent, we had to go to the counter to ask for anything, and the pans of raw chicken marinading right next to the table completed the picture.

Drinks: I ordered a passion fruit daiquiri, and got served a yellow daiquiri. I tasted it, and it was mango. I contacted the waiter and was told they could not make it for some reason he did not know. But instead of aking if I wanted something else they just served me mango.. I was able to get a new one, but would have preferred to be asked in advance. The strawberry daiquiri was good, as it came from a slush machine.

Food:
I ordered the pizza prosciutto e Burrata. I love burrata, but this was the hardest burrata I have ever had. The consistency was more like a mozarella. The crust was not airy, but dense.

We took a simple prosciutto pizza with tomatoes and enjoyed it a lot, I might only want it to be a bit juicier and to have a little bit more greens (arugula) but overall the experience was positive.

Service was quick, service-minded and polite. We got what we ordered fairly fast. They have great wines, and amazing table bread. Very lovely area to sit and enjoy a glass if wine, but unfortunately we thought the pasta and the food in general was way too salty. The only gluten free option they have is a grilled mackerel, which was also way too salty and a bit of a let down. It felt as though they had dropped a whole bottle if salt in the dishes. *Many italian style-restaurants have more than one gluten free option. Mostly risotto, but here, the risotto was not gluten free. Which sadlg left only one option. We asked for a side salad with the mackerel - got a few green leaves and some chopped red onion...

A lot of the items that were pictured in other reviews were no longer available with practically only dim sum, sushi and tasting menus remaining. Although a bit put off, we still decided to pull through and ordered four portions of the tasting menu priced at kr. 598 per person (7 dishes).

1. Laks cream cheese*
My personal favorite. Rich cream cheese that blends perfectly with the salmon. Topped with a well-paired sauce.

2-3. Har Gow & Hoi Sin Gow
Steamed dumplings, one portion with scampi and one portion with chinese chives. Tastes as expected. Good, but nothing special.

4. Gyoza
Regular dumpling. Tastes as expected. Good, but nothing special.

5. Friterte Biffrulle*
Fried beef roll. Taste is good, but is a bit on the greasy side. Also quite salty.

6. Kantonesisk Roast And*
Duck was great. Soft meat and crispy skin. Comes with steamed broccoli soaked in duck fat (salty). Previous reviews have shown this dish served with a portion of rice which was exactly what we thought was missing.

7. Dessert (rice chips; warm banana pie; vanilla ice cream)
Yummy dessert. Classic fried banana in the shape of a dumpling, which was cool, paired with vanilla ice cream. Great presentation.

Atmosphere / service
Friendly service and nice atmosphere. Great attention to detail in terms of decor, plating and utensils.

Price
A bit expensive. If you're eating for hunger you're probably going to have to order sushi unless you want to shell out ~4-700 NOK (2-3 dim sum or a menu, not including drinks).

5528,Pincho Nation Jernbanetorget,4.1,5.0,"One of my favorite places in Oslo ‚ò∫Ô∏è This was first time I‚Äôve ever experienced restaurant like this when I visited Oslo in 2019. Cute circus interior gets you back to childhood and mini dishes allow you to try many things at once! Food is always fresh and nicely served, drinks are amazing as well! What I mean by nicely served is for example meat balls served on a little little pan! How cute! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Definitely a ‚Äúmust-visit‚Äù especially for someone who hasn‚Äôt seen such place before (don‚Äôt think this restaurant is anywhere except Nordic countries)!",8 months ago,Justyna Sok√≥≈Ç
5529,Pincho Nation Jernbanetorget,4.1,4.0,"What a cool place! The circus theme is a treat, especially the bathrooms - once you lock the door a monologue by the circus master starts. There's a wide variety of food that can be shared tapas style (portions are not full sized) and an extensive drink menu (three cheers for the bartender who made an amazing drink for the 'surprise cocktail'). Food is ordered via the Princho mobile app and picked up at the service counter - be sure to keep an eye on the app because it is supposed to give a notification when the food is ready but sometimes the notification didn't come through.

The food itself is pretty good. We had the edamame, steak, pad Thai, sweet potato fries, fries, mushroom risotto, mushrooms, spring rolls, hmm can't remember what else. But everything was good, seems like you can't really go wrong.

It would be great if the circus theme was kicked up another notch - maybe some lighter music? A magician that performs on the hour? A person folding balloon animals? More circus-style food?  An actual menu would also be welcome because there are so many options but difficult to get an overview in the app where items are listed one by one which requires lots of scrolling. Other than that, this place is fun!

Pro tip: Make a reservation ahead of time because this place is also busy!",3 months ago,Monique Swanepoel

Ordering was done via an app that really could have been a webpage, and it has some usability issues (for example, ordering for the first time forces you to create an account, but does not actually submit the order afterwards, so you need to notice that and hit order again).

5541,Monsun Noodlebar,4.1,4.0,"Lots of vegan options, which we love. Clearly marked on a separate menu. The Korean fried rice was great! Would recommend that dish. The summer rolls were tasty but the rice paper wrapper was overly soft and fell apart. The sauce was great though. The spicy ramen was nice enough, but not the best I've had. Noodles went a bit soft, and the broth wasn't my thing. The mushrooms in it were lovely, and loved the spring onions!!

We were lucky to be sat in the ""good"", darker side of the restaurant, where the atmosphere was nicer. The other half was bright and a bit bare.

And the prices have increased a bit (that's understandable), but if I'm not mistaken the portions also have also decreased in size. That included the naan bread.

The waiter advised: ""Well, that's how we do it here""

Rule nr.1. When working in a restaurant:

The customer is always right, or at least you try to please his/her wills if possible.

The right answer would have been:
""Well sir, we normally just drop some could meat and frozen cheese from the fridge"", but as you are a Mexican complaining about Mexican food I can make the minimum effort of heating it up in the microwave, so that the cheese is melted"".

No doubt they make the best kardamomboller I have ever tasted in Oslo. Go early to get them;)

13.02.2021: So far, I have tasted the best fastelavnsbolle and semlor I have ever tasted in Oslo. Since I have been trying many different versions for the past week, I must say that I can really compare them. Both the one filled with jam and almond paste were amazingly delicious. The dough had enough amount of cardamom (can even be more since I love it!), which finally did not disappoint me because I believe in Norway they do not use much cardamom in the dough for semlor, the cream and jam were very fresh and the almond paste was so good. I wish they would continue making them at least for a day weekly, but tomorrow is your last chance so go get them and go early:)
PS: The sourdough bread with many seeds was heavenly, made a real magical touch to our breakfast. Much thanks to the lady working there who suggested this particular bread.

Good Peking duck but missed the proper crispy skin and the sauce was way too sweet.

The gung bao chicken had the wrong vegetables; string beans, broccoli, squash and lotus flower. Cashew instead of peanuts.

Stir fried spicy lamb was not bad. Tender lamb meat but unexciting taste overall.

Their fusion fried dimsum was dry and needed more dipping sauce.

5907,Eat Thai,4.2,2.0,"Hmmm I wanted to like this restaurant so bad based on photos and positive reviews and the good service but food wise-expectations just did not meet reality.

Drunken noodles are straight up American Chinese style noodles aka lo mein. Noodles are yellow egg noodles and not rice noodles, no Chinese broccoli, basil...and when did drunken noodles have big round slices of carrots? It‚Äôs basically a whole other dish with a misnomer. Not sure how they got away with serving lo mein as drunken noodles for this long?

Coconut curry soup was great but the portion was so small it was basically 40% of the bowl it came in. It‚Äôs almost as if someone had drank from it first before it arrived at the table. Duck was decent.

Lastly, it‚Äôs more of a to go place and not really a sit down restaurant. Pics made the interior look much bigger than it seemed. Service was counter and not really at table unless ordered through the QR code. The ladies working there were really nice though! No complaints about that at all.

Wouldn‚Äôt return unless you‚Äôre real desperate for ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù food but then you could search ‚ÄúAsian restaurants‚Äù, literally close your eyes, point your finger on google maps and go anywhere else.

They also have several kids chairs and the  whole shop is HCP- accessible in one floor, no steps.

My only complain about this shop is that they have doubled their prices in 5 years and is now unneccessary expensive for a mere burrito without any sides. I paid 185 kr for a burrito that is one of their originals that i paid 95 kr for in their early days.

As a suggestion it would be good to have some indication of what ingredients are behind the glass, some stuff is easy to recognise, some not.

We enjoyed it a lot though.  Definitely recommended",4 months ago,Marc Berry

6014,Hrimnir Ramen,4.5,2.0,"When Hrimnir first opened, their ramen was very delicious. I thought i found the best Japanese ramen in Norway and always brought new friends here. However, the last several visits have been disappointing.

The broth is not flavourful or balanced, and we have tried 3 different kinds of ramen too. I brought two friends in November and 2 different friends today, and all of them were excited at first but disappointed in the ramen. Not to mention this time we were given so little broth that it was below the noodles...

I hope Hrimnir can recover back to the delicious ramens they used to serve in the beginning, because until then I don't think I will be coming back anymore as it's no longer good. The staff is always friendly though. Don't trust the old positive reviews, it's gone down in quality unfortunately.",a week ago,Jimin Jung

6142,Koie Ramen Munch,4.4,4.0,"This must be among the toppers in all the ramen shops I've tried. We came here twice in our two day trip to the city.

It has such rich and deeply flavoured broth, the noodles were soft yet springy till the end of the bowl. The toppings were mostly well executed. A highlight was the eggs which were nicely marinated and had this beautifully silky yolk texture that was somehow missed in many restaurants. What a joy to eat! I did miss the oniony sharpness from the sliced scallions though, and some bamboo shoot pieces were a bit fibrous.

For the sides, I loved the gyoza!  The karaage was good but paled in comparison. Lightly battered, spiced, crispy and not oily and the meat was soft and juicy. However it felt too salty and there was this raw floury feel lingering after each bite.

Still it was overall a solid experience. Tasty food, excellent presentation as icing on the cake, and decently priced in otherwise expensive Oslo.",4 months ago,Nhu Anh Phan

I called the restaurant twice, and every time the same (just 2 minutes). And of course finally, food is cold and the order is missing 2 cola.

Ventilation just gave up on day two of our stay and it became humid everyday after that, no one would come look at it or fix it.

Hotel breakfast was way overpriced and not at all sanitary. Little to choose from and the fruit tasted like it had been cut from the same knife as the rest of the onions and vegetables.

We had a rather small room ""small economy double room"" and it was really small. One couldn't open two check in luggage at the same time. There were no night desks. So, we had to use our luggage for that. The room itself was clean, yet we could hear noise from the outside as well during the night. Since we were on floor 5, we could not hear anything from the ground floor.

The self check in surprised us, but that's our fault. It was the first time, so before this stay I didn't pay attention while booking. Anyway, we managed to check in and in retrospective it's fine for me.

6187,Maaemo,4.7,5.0,"Maaemo was one of the best Michelin experiences I have had and the restaurant is well deserving of their 3 stars. I had the pleasure of solo dining during my trip to Oslo and I was welcomed and made to feel at home from the very beginning. The 18 course tasting menu took 3.5 hours and the pacing of each dish felt great. Each plate came out as artwork - the explanations provided by the staff complimented the experience. The wine pairing, while pricy for what is offered, blended beautifully into the each course. All of the staff members who came by my table were pleasant to talk to and were always willing to answer any questions or have a small conversation. I would recommend Maaemo to anyone visiting Oslo.

At the end of my multi floor experience, I was escorted to their cocktail bar down the street and would urge everyone to combine these two experiences into an amazing night to remember.",9 months ago,Tyler Entner

Sometimes challenging to hear what was being explained about the dishes, but no problem asking for a repeat and more details on raw materials and methods. The wine pairing was excellent.

One of my favourite fine dining experiences, and if you check out my profile you'll know that's a high bar to clear.

Excellent service, fantastic food, overall awesome experience. Came here with friends and we all loved it.

Liked most of the dishes, which is difficult for a tasting menu to do. Loved the bread in particular, and the menu looked like there was thought put into making everything cohesive.

At this price point and restaurant style you expect great service, interesting dishes, and care put into the dishes i.e. not just phoning it in. Maaemo delivered.

They can be flexible with beverage pairings too.

First - nice that if you want a beer, you need to chose bottle of one of the two Thai beers. About food - I tried Tom Yum with shrimps - delicious, spicy, tasty, really reminded my my visit in Thailand few years ago; Gaeng ped- red curry with chicken - as good as Tom Yum, less spicy maybe due to coconut milk, but full of flavours. Third dish Pad Himapan - wok plate with cashew nut ( on the second photo ) was so-so, not so rich in taste and consistency of the sauce was a little to jelly for my taste. Still, ok fish.

Although I don‚Äôt live in Oslo anymore, having a meal at Skaal has become a must-do for me every time when I‚Äôm back here. However, our experience this time disappointed us, big time. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore, at least until they change the menu again. The two stars I gave here are even a bit generous, but one of the stars is for the good wine, the other one gives credit to the good job they used to do.

First, the service had been extremely friendly, helpful and passionate before. I could recall the waiters still smiling to everyone and trying to engage with the customers all the time on full-house rush hours. This time though, some of the waitresses had this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t‚Äù kind of attitude ‚Äî sort of rushing us to order, never explained the food in details like they used to do before, and didn‚Äôt even notice that our water bottle was empty. (Please note that we were one of the 4 tables dining at the time) We were shocked that the service style went from maximal attention down to less than minimal. Worst of all, no one ever asked how our food was, which was incredibly strange. We had 6 dishes, which means they had plenty of chances to check on us but they simply didn‚Äôt.

Second, as mentioned above that no one ever cared to ask if the food was good, here‚Äôs an answer: generally awful ‚Äî bear in mind that this is not a cheap eatery. In regard of the pricing, one of the dishes was good, three were ok, two were just edible.

The only good one was the oysters. They managed to buy good quality oysters and opened them without leaving pieces of shells on the flesh, bravo. The clear slightly spicy sauce served with the oysters, which was obviously allegedly a style of ‚Äúleche de tigre‚Äù, was good. Maybe change the name before Peruvians get mad.

The Bolinhos had good flavors, but were cold inside, and had an unpleasant rancid taste probably from the frying oil. Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka. Also because we left the restaurant with disappointment and confusion, and it used to be satisfaction with exceptional food and amazing service a few months ago.",2 months ago,Kinciyang B√∏ng

6293,Izakaya,4.6,3.0,"First thing that struck me as odd was that there is no system for getting a table; they don't take reservations and they do not allow you to queue, so you simply have to show up and hope there's a spot available. If not, they turn you away with no explanation for their absolute lack of a system.

The food itself was good, very good for the price, but not terribly exciting. I was pleased, but I suppose I expected something more; crispier gyoza and pancake, more flavour on the eggs, more sauce on dishes that had it, and a slightly lighter touch for flavours like sesame which in dense amounts can be sickeningly overwhelming.

However, service was quick and for the prices, I can't complain much. It simply felt as if their aim was authenticity, and in my opinion they were off.",a year ago,Sharon

We drunk a Pale Ale beer that was very good and a rice beer that was surprisingly good and tasty.
Food was also good, and very home made.
We pay 1000kr but I felt like the experience, even tho the food was super good, was not nice or worthy because the place was not as good, in the sitting area you could eat next to 2 fridges and 2 freezers and actually I prefer and appreciate other standards, the restaurant is looking like what I can guess a Japanese house on the inside.

We entered the unmarked establishment (save a small poster on the side door entrance) and were immediately impressed by the strong authentic Japanese feel of the bar. In short, it was like a bar was magically teleported from the streets of Shinjuko into downtown Oslo.

The bar featured a variety of Japanese beer, (including a porter and an IPA) and even had Kirin on draught. We ordered Cucuumber Kimchi, Gyoza, Edamame. The Gyoza, in my opinion, was above average and clearly made fresh. The dessert was fantastic!

The customer is always right, or at least you try to please his/her wills if possible.

The right answer would have been:
""Well sir, we normally just drop some could meat and frozen cheese from the fridge"", but as you are a Mexican complaining about Mexican food I can make the minimum effort of heating it up in the microwave, so that the cheese is melted"".

However, for two people, one small bowl of rice just wasn‚Äôt enough. Either make it bigger or give each person their own. We had to order extra naan to compensate for that part.

Service was very good, allthough we had to wait a while to order, same thing with getting the bill. This seemed to be a problem for others as well. Our waiter was nice and pro active, where some of the others didnt seem to care all that much about us at all. Almost like they avoided us.

After a long while she finally acknowledged she had made mistake. We waited about an hour for our food, which was good but not outstanding.

6357,Nimbu Indisk Restaurant,4.1,5.0,"The ambience of Nimbu is very calming, like entering a spa-inspired modern Indian restaurant. It just opened last week, and exerts the fresh feeling. 5/5

The tastes of the dishes are good. I would expect a little more given the competition in Indian restaurants for certain flavors. We ordered all vegetarian dishes, out which the Kadhai paneer and blue cheese naan were best. The Bavariso- dessert sure was a wow-factor, but the Kulfi (even missing the folooda) was seriously good! 4/5

6472,Lille Saigon,4.0,2.0,I recently moved to Oslo for work and I tried a few vietnamese restaurants in town. Since my friends told me about this place. I decided to give it a shot. It took almost half an hour since the moment I walked in and when the food was brought to my table. It wasn't even rush hour because I went there around 2pm... I ordered their pork ribs and shredded with rice. As you can see there was hardly any shredded pork on my plate. Not to mention the pork meat was overcooked therefore it was dry and chewy. The seasoning was fine though. Besides the rice was cheap rice not even basmati rice. Very disappointing experience at this place. For me it's way overpriced and I personally don't think about coming back anytime soon. As a result this place only deserves 2 stars in my opinion.,3 months ago,Paul Taek

Instead of taking away like most people who came in, my family occupied one of the few  (bar chair) tables in the place. The menu is primarily in Norwegian, but if you're familiar with the typical sushi words 'maki, tempura etc', it's not that difficult to discern what the menu says. The staff politely answered any questions we had, and acquiesced to our request to make half a sushi roll spicy and half not (for dad), which was very nice of them.

In the end we ordered '05' under 'Sushi meny' 'F4' (Futo seafood) and 'F7' (Futo crispy duck) twice under 'Futo Maki'. We'd never had crispy duck in sushi before, but it was delicious!

It was neat to try seal, whale and the portions were huge, as well as fresh caught, and priced were reasonable but everything you could order was cooked the same with minimal seasoning, which is fine with fresh caught fish but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a place to get a more ‚Äúhome cooked, maybe cheaper, Filling meal with no bells and whistles‚Äù staff was not very helpful, she couldn‚Äôt tell me main differences in style of each dish so just said, ‚Äúorder this, it‚Äôs popular‚Äù.And we asked for veggies vs potatoes and just got the salad side that came regardless with no extra, which is fine but still. Staff played on her phone the whole time and we had to ask to order, for the drink menu a second time and for our check.  Decor was tacky but cute, and it was empty so no wait to sit, just wait for the staff to get off her phone (which I have to say  she did do once we approached her). We were told by a local chef we met having beers it is very touristy (and yes we found it in a popular tour book haha) also a semi far walk from town area but I still thought it was good.

Hotel lysebu

The hotel is located on a quiet part of the mountain. It is cool here and even though you have not got a wide view on the Oslofjord, the view is still very beautiful.

The hotel consists of several buildings and has a very special feel. There is a lot of art in the buildings, as well as a grand piano. I think the hotel is excellent for private parties, like weddings. The most becoming however is the silence (even though a small group of people were a bit loud in the common room, as well as their baby).

The staircase in our building (to be fair, we had an upgrade to a more luxurious room) is made of concrete and smelled and felt like the concrete monastery of Le Corbusier. It had a bit of a ‚Äò70‚Äôs vibe, in a good way, so it gave me a nice sentiment as well. The whole place felt like a nice retreat, excellent for meditation.

The swimming pool is worth mentioning. It is not a depressing smelly tub, but quite big with nice (smelling) and spacious dressing rooms. There is the sauna as well, also very nice. The gym is in that area as well. All included for guests. No fuzz with codes or keys.

Also worth mentioning is that the whole place is littered with quite excellent coffee machines Nespresso (the nice ones) or the WMF machines with beans. There is also quite a collection of tea available. There are nice common rooms to gather with your group. Our (pretty big) room had a nice couch, so we kept it private.

Also worth mentioning: the best breakfast buffet in Norway. There is a lot of choice, but also a lot of fresh and very tasty fruit. Even the orange juice (normally from a machine) tasted as if it was made from oranges. All standard things were there but also honey from the grate, special bread, kn√§ckebr√∂d, fish, vegetables, yoghurt etc. Not the standard stuff, but the good stuff and plenty of it.

Personnel is also very nice and shows a lot of interest. I love that, it means you care, even if it‚Äôs just about your business.

And they care. The hotel is in excellent condition, clean, well taken care of and very nicely designed. I loved the art. Need to mention that twice. It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs the best and nice to be able to give them a full five stars (first time ever; I‚Äôm quite critical). They earn it in every way.

We will certainly return to the lovely Oslo, maybe even just for this beautiful hotel.",6 months ago,Bob P

Pets are welcome. Parking is provided with plenty of parking slots free of charge. A big plus for us was the chance to park the car and then take the metro #1 into the Oslo center. The walk from the hotel takes 10min to the Metro station and the metro itself takes 30min to reach the center. Another big plus was the great breakfast.

However, we were frustrated about several things that shouldn't occur in a 5 star hotel. It was not possible to get a cappuccino for at least 2.5 days, the water for making a tea was not hot, the quality of the dinner is vastly exaggerated and the service is unimpressive. The room was not very clean, the showers need maintanance, and there was not enough toilet paper and no telephone in the room to ask the reception for new supplies.

6614,De Mi Tierra,4.6,5.0,"I have been to Argentina many times where I am always on the lookout for the best empanadas. Even there I have sometimes been disappointed just because there is some much to choose from. So I didn't have any particular expectations when I was scrolling through Wolt and found De Mi Tierra. Also because I don't know of any other place in Oslo selling empanadas.

I received my order and the first thing I noticed was the great presentation. A cute little box as if I had been given a gift. Then I opened the box to find the little gems of empanadas inside. They looked perfect, just as I had remembered the good ones in Argentina. And they all tasted great. Instantly I could tell that these had been made with love, and using authentic flavours. I had the fried ones, but you can also get them baked. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chimichurri sauce also tasted fresh and fragrant. Overall a real delight, and I was pleasantly surprised. One portion of 5 was enough for me.

Again talking about the presentation : the bag, the box, and the pot for the chimichurri are all made from paper (there was also a small wooden spoon). It's a relief to finally find packaging which is recyclable and not plastic ! Small details here, but shows the attention to details.

I would highly recommend. If you want to have a break from all the sushi and burger places, give these guys a try, you won't regret it. Next time I will go to their place in person to enjoy a coffee an alfajor.

Original review December 2022

Fantastic cosy cafe conveniently located right next to Majorstuen T-Bane station. The vibe is great, the cakes are top quality and so is the hot chocolate with whipped cream! The other day I had one of their ""cookies"" which was like no other cookie I've ever eaten- without doubt the best!!!  It was so good it deserves to be renamed. The cafe seems to be open much later than other cafes in Majorstuen.  Definitely worth checking out.",2 weeks ago,Tavishi Matthews
6626,Mr. Bowl Oslo,4.8,5.0,"This place is a MUST! I do not tend to write reviews but the quality of the food and the kind hearted man who served us deserves nothing less. Oslo is very pricey so we were very hesitant initially as the place is a little hidden however we went for it and we loved it so much that we came every day that we stayed here! The quantities are extremely generous with so much much flavour. If you are in Oslo the chicken spring rolls, the chicken fried rice, the noodles and the dual fried chicken were a 11/10!

6634,Brasserie Blanche,4.6,5.0,"Excellent french cuisine in Oslo. Friendly staff and food was amazing.

Beef tartar ü•©
Good flavor soft and creamy texture, paired perfectly with dijon mustard, while the chips gives some texture.

Snail üêå
Was served without the shell in garlic butter, probably for convenience, as i prefer it to be served in shell normally.

Coq au vin chicken üêî
Crispy chicken thigh was amazing with the hint of sourness from the red wine based sauce.

Entrecote ü•©
One of the boring dishes but the homemade bearnaise sauce made up for it, with fresh estragon and vinegar reduction.

Mountain troutüêü
Good flavor with some spring vegetables. Perfectly fried fresh and moist flavor.

Sea sole üêü
Fried with bone in, good flavor when accompanied by the brown almond butter.

Apple tarte tartin üçé
Nice sour apple flavor with crisp caramelized outer tarte. Served warm with vanilla ice on top

Rabarbra soup
Sweet cold soup with some crunchy rabarbra pieces around. With a pudding and ice sorbet on top. Sorbet had a very fresh taste and a perfect dessert to end the meal with.",5 months ago,D

6651,Pokalen Aker Brygge,3.7,4.0,"Hmm - mixed feelings because I went there a few times this weekend to watch football, which I saw. So mission accomplished there. Screens all around- the main large one is blocked by the stage and therefore band equipment (I moved it- perhaps I shouldn't have). All the other screens are either too high to see from infront of or just a little small to see from the opposite side.. but still fine. It was empty when we first went, and I mean, we were the only 3 people in there- ordering food, I was a little sceptical as reviews are sketchy at best, but was assured that the staff know that and as the kitchen had just started and the chefs were waiting for their first order, that we'd be ok - that they were on it. First, the burger and chips - all cooked well with nice ingredients (although one friend said it was just ok), I thought it was really good, including the nicely crisped chips. Second, some truffle pasta dish, which my other friend thought was delicious - I have since disowned him as the pasta was hugely overcooked and sloppy (as seen in pic), although tasty (because cheese and truffles are tasty), was more like a truffle risotto. Some mix ups the next day too with certain screens being turned over in the middle of matches, and I ordered a fried chicken side, to be told that they didn't have chicken, did I want a chicken Cesar salad instead! Different chicken was the answer, but turns out they did have the fried chicken, and it came out almost 1 minute later, and actually was very nice",4 months ago,Marc Berry

6786,Gangnam Restaurant,4.5,5.0,"We have ordered the 4 course menu number 2, it came with one Kimchi pancake and one Kimchi and Beef dumpling each as the appetizer. All tasted excellent. As the Entr√©e, we have received a bowl of Topokki in chili sauce, also fantastic. For our main course we had Korean fried chicken and thinly sliced beef stir fry. The fried chicken was crispy and tender although thoroughly marinated in an astonishing sauce. The entrec√¥te was tender and juicy. Since the two dishes shared a plate the spices of both meats and the accompanying vegetables were mixed beautifully and harmonized heavenly. I couldn‚Äôt have wished for a better desert sweet and refreshing the plate was the best possible finish. The green tea ice cream took the heat, of wich there could have been more, away from your tastebuds. The mushy pancake and the sticky rice cake cleansed you mouth of any remaining oils.

Alongside the meal we enjoyed 20cl of Jinro‚Äòs fruit Soju. The only one available at the time was plum, wich in my opinion, having tried all other flavors, is the best. If you‚Äôve never tried Soju before or only drank Lotte Liquor‚Äòs Chum Churum, Jinro‚Äòs Chamisul Fresh, the basis for the fruit version, is way softer and rounder. While Chum Churum is an after dinner drink, Jinro‚Äôs Soju can be enjoyed all throughout. If you‚Äôve never tried Korean Soju before, think of it as a milder yet more tasteful/ rich version of Japanese sake (Sake recommendation: Urakasumi Junmai Misty Bay - is the way to go).

The atmosphere was very calm, with rather unspectacular furniture, the mood was set by some quite K-Pop, such as Ribbon by BamBam, music in the background and several paintings and pictures showcasing Korea, in all it‚Äôs glory. Since all light sources were aimed at the wall the room was well lit but still very soft and diffused.

Regarding the service, it was, as expected very kind, willing to help and accommodating. We were greeted by a nice Korean gentleman. Our food was served by a, non Korean, young Asian gentleman who told us all he could about the foreign Food. As we left I‚Äôve asked for a small Korean lesson and a nice lady came from the kitchen to teach me how to properly say hello and goodbye in Korean. My previous knowledge turned out to be quite wrong.

Continuing with my bad Korean skills:

I understand that cross contamination can be difficult when you use the same tools, even though generally, a good wash and some care is all it takes. But this is not traces, and if this can happen to such a degree on items that are, and I quote, ""nut and almond free"", then it points to zero real effort towards avoiding contamination with actual full sized pieces of nuts/almonds, and no one with allergies towards these (and other food items) should feel comfortable eating here.

6849,SKAAL Matbar,4.4,2.0,"This place became our favorite after several visits. Although I don‚Äôt live in Oslo anymore, having a meal at Skaal has become a must-do for me every time when I‚Äôm back here. However, our experience this time disappointed us, big time. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore, at least until they change the menu again. The two stars I gave here are even a bit generous, but one of the stars is for the good wine, the other one gives credit to the good job they used to do.

First, the service had been extremely friendly, helpful and passionate before. I could recall the waiters still smiling to everyone and trying to engage with the customers all the time on full-house rush hours. This time though, some of the waitresses had this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t‚Äù kind of attitude ‚Äî sort of rushing us to order, never explained the food in details like they used to do before, and didn‚Äôt even notice that our water bottle was empty. (Please note that we were one of the 4 tables dining at the time) We were shocked that the service style went from maximal attention down to less than minimal. Worst of all, no one ever asked how our food was, which was incredibly strange. We had 6 dishes, which means they had plenty of chances to check on us but they simply didn‚Äôt.

Second, as mentioned above that no one ever cared to ask if the food was good, here‚Äôs an answer: generally awful ‚Äî bear in mind that this is not a cheap eatery. In regard of the pricing, one of the dishes was good, three were ok, two were just edible.

The only good one was the oysters. They managed to buy good quality oysters and opened them without leaving pieces of shells on the flesh, bravo. The clear slightly spicy sauce served with the oysters, which was obviously allegedly a style of ‚Äúleche de tigre‚Äù, was good. Maybe change the name before Peruvians get mad.

The Bolinhos had good flavors, but were cold inside, and had an unpleasant rancid taste probably from the frying oil. Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka. Also because we left the restaurant with disappointment and confusion, and it used to be satisfaction with exceptional food and amazing service a few months ago.",2 months ago,Kinciyang B√∏ng

6880,San Francisco Bread Bowl,4.6,5.0,"Service:
Great, no complaints. They let me order the mac N cheese as a side, as opposed to in a bread bowl as they normally serve it. Plus for that.

Food:
I ordered a side of mac N cheese and the Indonesian soup in a bread bowl. When the food came my heart sank a bit when I saw the max and cheese BUT! The taste was there. It's more of a stove top style mac and cheese as opposed to being baked, which is what I'm used to. But it tasted great. Didn't regret it. The soup was also delicious. I thought the bread would be a hard, gum bruiser but alas...it was not. Instead it was soft.

Drinks:
I had a tequila and grapefruit drink...delish. I want to go back just for that drink. Nice amount of tartness to balance the bitterness.

The restaurant:
It's quaint and cozy, with seating outside, in the first floor and a second floor...or sort of indoor balcony for lack of a better description. The furniture upstairs where I sat was low tables and sofas. So much better if you're just drinking. Not that comfortable when eating. You also run a much higher risk of getting soup on yourself.

The decor is unique in that there are pictures throughout the restaurant dedicated to telling the story of the owner's immigrant parents - very nice and unique touch I felt.The restaurant has done a fantastic job of being traditionally Indian while mixing in modern elements. The menu has something for everyone - traditional curries are offered as well as street-food style appetizers. The presentation of the food and drinks was exceptional.

Visiting Oslo and thought of ordering food online. Came to this place through Foodora, although the restaurant is responsible for food delivery. After one hour, got a notification on the app that it's less than 5 minutes to get the food, i thought of going down to get the food as they wrote (no contact delivery) and the surprise was that it took an hour after getting the (less than 5 minutes) notification. I called the restaurant twice, and every time the same (just 2 minutes). And of course finally, food is cold and the order is missing 2 cola.

No menu! You don't choose your food, but instead get invited to a 10 course dinner of various foods , selected by the chef. The dishes are small of course and vary from sashimi to beef. (See photos). So much going on with each dish, very refined and very tasty. They serve you very nice accompanying wine as well.

It's a small establishment and very laid back. Loved the environment and choice of music, which reminded me more of a bar than a restaurant. In fact it was like a cocktail bar, but for food. Right up my street.
It's not on the cheap side though, but what is in Oslo.

I was also taken care of very well by the very friendly and attentive staff/waiters. Thanks guys!

The dessert consisted of pickled plums, biscuits, fermented plum ice cream and meringue. The food was just amazingly good and tasty. Along with the menu, we got an absolutely fantastic bread.

7096,Kanpai Sushi x Izakaya,4.6,4.0,"Pros: The food was excellent! We ordered the Wagyu yaki, the Iberico yaki, the ribs, the lamb chops, and the Katsu soba. The Iberico yaki and ribs were phenomenal, they are might be even better than the Wagyu, to be honest! The charcoal does make everything taste so much better. I also really love the sweet potato puree, the pastinakk krem and the cabbage pickles that served with the dishes.
The waitress who served was extremely nice (the asian girl who can't speak Norwegian). She was very friendly.

Cons: On the other hand, there was a male server (long hair) who was a bit unfriendly. He made us feel a bit unwelcomed when we first arrive at the restaurant and was not very service-minded.
The Katsu soba was ok, but not very special. The truffle cream even though tasted very good on its own, it did not go well with the chicken katsu cutlet - it made the chicken taste so rich and easy to get tired off. I also would rather my veggies be cooked a bit more done.
Aside from the good sides I mentioned above, some sides were not that good. The grilled padron pepper was very bitter (I expected chili peppers to be sweet and have some heat), and it did not go well with the Iberico. The Daikon pickles were unevenly cut thus there were some very thick pieces that were not properly pickled and had an unpleasant raw taste. The grilled broccolini was good, however, if you are going to serve the end stem, you should peel the outside a bit since those tend to be very fibrous and unpleasant to eat.
One biggest letdown was the wooden 1-time-use chopsticks! I have expected some decent chopsticks when dining out in a fancy restaurant. I did not expect to see those cheap ones you can get at a corner/kiosk sushi store. They were very unpleasant to use as they were shorter and smaller than our usual size of home chopsticks. Also, if you are gonna serve dishes which have pieces of meat and puree, you should provide a knife and fork automatically as it is impossible to eat those kinds of food with just chopsticks (how can one eat puree and cut meat with chopsticks, this is coming from a Vietnamese who have used chopsticks forever).

Overall, it was a good night! I love the food so much so I will definitely come back.",11 months ago,Ngan Huynh Bao

Then got foil myself and proved their mistake, still refused but was able to get someone else to look at it. Another fitter looked at it and confirmed that the solar film was of the wrong percentage.

Was asked to deliver the car early and pick it up this afternoon. Delivered the car early, called this afternoon to check the status; hadn't started, but it shouldn't take long.

7236,Handwerk,3.7,1.0,"It pains me to leave a bad review for a place that has so much potential. We chose the cafe  to have lunch after our wedding last week (June) with 11 guests, around 1PM on a Friday. Their website advertises about emailing them for group orders, in which reservations can be made for larger groups - both outdoors and indoors if the weather isn't great.

I emailed them in April. It was confirmed that it would be no problem to make a reservation + pre-order food, and reserve the small indoor room. Initial back and forth communication was fine. I asked if the menu was up to date and told yes.

I sent over our selections from the menu in late May. I didn‚Äôt hear back, sent a follow up email, and subsequent phone call. I called again two days before the wedding, and was told the menu changed, so none of the things we ordered were now available (ie. Hot chicken, Brunch sampler plate, etc.) I ordered simple sandwiches, thinking they would at least all be ready for us when we arrived.

When we arrived for our reservation, nothing was prepared. No tables outdoors reserved or wiped down, the indoor room had other guests sitting in there so there wasn‚Äôt room for us when we got there. Our guests tried to piece together some outdoor tables, which still had other past cafe guests food on them.

We went up to the counter to ask what was going on, but the workers had no idea what reservations we were talking about. It was complete chaos and a disappointing experience. Sandwiches slowly came out over the next 15-20 minutes, so we did not all eat at the same time. We were either accidentally given dirty coffee cups or they were not thoroughly washed, as my husband and I had to rinse them before passing on to the guests. Some of the waitstaff tried to be helpful, while others were clearly annoyed.

I wouldn‚Äôt leave a bad review for a small business without understanding the potential repercussions. I want them to do well. It‚Äôs conveniently located in the Botanical Gardens, is aesthetically cute and not a chain cafe. However, I strongly encourage them that until their cafe is prepared to take group orders or reservations, that they remove this option completely from their website. As of today, the menu remains not updated. If someone emails your cafe inquiring about group reservations, consider responding that it‚Äôs not something your cafe currently has the capacity to do. Less disappointment and stress for everyone involved.

Perhaps an ok place to stop in if you are passing by and see they have an open table. Not a place to make group reservations on your wedding day or any other day when organization, following a time schedule, or all guests getting to eat at the same time is important for you.",8 months ago,Gina Mastrianni

We went to another Italian restaurant and they sent us out empty handed when we asked for Vegetarian options.  We were served by Mario (Not sure if he was the owner, given that he claimed that he was from Portugal), but it was nothing short of awesome. He listened to our needs, made accommodation to entrees and served us very delicious food. He also helped us select our wine and it was excellent.  It is priced slightly above average, but food and service-wise, I would rate them excellent.  If I am in Oslo, I would definitely go there again.",5 months ago,Shekar Chandrasekaran

7246,Prima Fila Restaurant,4.3,5.0,"In short:
Pretty good Italian food, served quite fast, despite being highly visited.

More precise:
We, a group of 13, arrived at the restaurant, got a perfectly fitting table right away. After ordering we got our food after about 15-30 min which I consider quite fast. To my knowledge we had not a single complaint about the food. The desserts were extraordinary.

7248,Delicatessen Majorstuen,4.2,3.0,"The food is good very similar to authentic Spaniard tapas. Having a pretty consisten quality to the other times I have been there. The waiting times are a little long but you are compensated for your patience with a good meal.

What really takes down your experience is the uncomfortable interior decoration (hard chairs and very little space between tables) as well as the badly trained waiters. They have no idea of proper serving etiquette multiple times the waiter will reach in front of you to grab things and then stack all the empty plate in front of you on top of the table before taking them away.

And while I understand the rush waiters have especially in days with a full restaurant. It would be nice if they could stop to answer questions about the food or check if anything is needed in the table.

I give the restaurant a solid 3 which could easily go up if they fixed there issues with the service. Definitely recommend a reservation before going as waiting times for a table can be pretty long!!",3 months ago,Andres Sandoval

I looked at all the negative reviews in here and they clearly were left from newer patients after the merger.  The customer service of Eastside as a whole should not be a poor reflection on Dr. Zafar who is an amazing doctor!   The staff that were hired by Dr Zafar prior to this merger were exceptional, kind, understanding and professional.  In fact , Phyllis who is an exceptional Physician Assistant is still with Dr Zafar.  Dr Zafar is the type of doctor who looks out for the patient and what‚Äôs best for their health.  If you want a doctor who just writes prescriptions or you tell her what you want despite protocol, that is not the professional doctor she is.  She truly cares for her patient‚Äôs well-being!  Also, since there are many doctors who merged under the umbrella of Eastside Medical, the staff people complained about in previous reviews most likely are not the staff that Dr. Zafar chose for the office.  Dr.  Zafar is amazing.  Both my husband and I love the services she offers to her patients.  She is so good that a lot of the time she is also scheduled months out.

The person I spoke to advised me to call in the morning to see if she has any cancellations for the day but I am a working individual. Her schedule caters to more retired individuals not working people. So if if you work this is not the doctor's office for you. The other thing is they do not send reminders about annual testing.

Spicy Hamachi deluxe maki üç£
Nicely prepared maki roll with hamachi and topped with a home made salsa on top. Fish was alright and had the freshness you expect from a norwegian restaurant. The salsa gave the dish a nice sour note and paired well.

Crunchy Maguro (tuna) üç£
Maki roll with tuna fish rolled in panko bread crumbs, that were not fried. First of all the tuna was not really fresh and tasted little, but was acceptable with some panko breadcrumbs on the outside giving some texture and a mayo based dip on top.

Orange chicken bao bun NYC
Not exiting at all, just some fried chicken bits rolled in panko breadcrumb. Topped with orange sauce. Chicken was average but sauce was good with strong orange flavor.

Vegan
Spicy Zakura (Vegan)
The Zalmon or imitation salmon tasted sorta simmilar to salmon. Texture was a inbetween a jelly candy and raw salmon. Flavor was alright but cant call it salmon.

Dirty shrimp maki (Vegan)
Shrimp just tasted like tofu, should just have called it tofu. As it has little to no simmilarities with shrimp texture or flavor wise. Maki was otherwise good topped with a handful of sweet potato fries.",2 weeks ago,D

7376,The Broker,3.9,1.0,"I had a terrible experience having lunch here a few weeks ago.

For one while I had a reservation I was still sent to a table at the very back when all the front areas of the restaurant were empty. The waiter was horrid, it was impossible to get his attention to ask any questions about the food, more than a few times after seeing us needing attention he ignored us and continued not doing anything.

The food was good nothing incredible but pretty decent. We had the burger and fish and chips. Finally we ordered dessert; a tea and an espresso. While i understand that all orders are made through the app it took a very long time to get our drinks and once we got them the waiter informed us that they did not make espresso and left. He did not even give an option for another drink and before we even had a chance to say that we had already payed for it to get the refund. We waited for a good 30 minutes to see if he came back towards are table to let him know but he was nowhere to be found so we decided to leave.

And the few times the waiter did come close to the table was when he went to the kitchen to yell at the chef right behind us which by that point was the only one doing a good job.

It is not that I mind loosing the money for the drink or that the food was bad. It is the terribly arrogant attitude of the waiter which makes me angry.

I would definitely recommend avoiding this place!",3 months ago,Andres Sandoval

I understand that can be the case but you shouldn‚Äôt show that as a waiter. Disappointed with that.

7495,Kinabolle Gr√∏nland,4.4,5.0,"This is one of my two favorite Asian restaurants in Oslo, and I recommend you try the 1) hand-pulled noodles, 2) handmade dumplings, and the 3) sweet and spicy chicken. The noodles are chewy and fatty flavor bombs, and the dumplings and the sauce are a juicy reminder of food back at home. I say this as a Korean-American who spent the last 5 years in San Francisco, and has eaten copious amounts of Asian food in Korea, Japan, China, and at home.

I would like to write a disclaimer that this does not include Vietnamese food. Vietnamese are the 4th largest immigrant population in Norway, so there seems to be a wealth of Vietnamese food around Oslo. Therefore, I think it deserves a category of its own.

If you love reading reviews as much as I like writing them, the following is for you:

1. I can see and feel the care that the women and men put into their dishes
2. They have a small menu and everything on their menu has a reason for being there
3. They have wifi, so if you need to grab a meal and get stuff done, you can do both
4. There is a lot of seating; you'll see once you walk in, there's a larger area inside
5. It's a great place to grab dinner with a group of friends at the end of the week
6. They serve beer and cider for all those who want to loosen up a bit
7. Very reasonably priced with good portions, so if you and your friend aren't that hungry, you can easily share a rice or noodle dish as a snack
8. Admittedly, the ambience could be a little more lively with some music, but easily a place you can fill with the laughter of you and your friends

Paying this price, I would expect all of the food to be not only tasty, but at the very very least well cooked. Unfortunately, some of the dumplings were doughy and chewy, and just not properly cooked. The fried dumpling topped with chanterelles was very underdone on the inside, and the chanterelles themselves were soft and mushy. The soup dumpling had tough dough on the outside and a sticky, underdone layer on the inside. I admit that everything did taste quite good, but the overall composition and preparation was not great, and certainly not worth the money. Aside from this, the server seemed to have a had time explaining the food and the wine, which is fine if they are just new to the job, but they weren't even able to tell us the country the wine was from.

The dish was small with just some normal coleslaw and boiled potatoes. Not very exciting at all. Worst of all was that the potatoes were really undercooked. I told the waitress and she returned the dish to the kitchen. When I finally got it back the potatoes were still undercooked! So for the second time I told the waitress that the potatoes were undercooked. This time I didn‚Äôt want to risk it anymore so I asked for the hamburger instead. Whilst I was waiting for the hamburger the manager came out to apologise and said that I didn‚Äôt have to pay for the burger. Very professional of him. The hamburger was tasty but the fries were not properly fried and a bit soggy. The staff in general is not very attentive and it takes a long time even to get the drinks you order.

7608,SKAAL Matbar,4.4,2.0,"This place became our favorite after several visits. Although I don‚Äôt live in Oslo anymore, having a meal at Skaal has become a must-do for me every time when I‚Äôm back here. However, our experience this time disappointed us, big time. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore, at least until they change the menu again. The two stars I gave here are even a bit generous, but one of the stars is for the good wine, the other one gives credit to the good job they used to do.

First, the service had been extremely friendly, helpful and passionate before. I could recall the waiters still smiling to everyone and trying to engage with the customers all the time on full-house rush hours. This time though, some of the waitresses had this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t‚Äù kind of attitude ‚Äî sort of rushing us to order, never explained the food in details like they used to do before, and didn‚Äôt even notice that our water bottle was empty. (Please note that we were one of the 4 tables dining at the time) We were shocked that the service style went from maximal attention down to less than minimal. Worst of all, no one ever asked how our food was, which was incredibly strange. We had 6 dishes, which means they had plenty of chances to check on us but they simply didn‚Äôt.

Second, as mentioned above that no one ever cared to ask if the food was good, here‚Äôs an answer: generally awful ‚Äî bear in mind that this is not a cheap eatery. In regard of the pricing, one of the dishes was good, three were ok, two were just edible.

The only good one was the oysters. They managed to buy good quality oysters and opened them without leaving pieces of shells on the flesh, bravo. The clear slightly spicy sauce served with the oysters, which was obviously allegedly a style of ‚Äúleche de tigre‚Äù, was good. Maybe change the name before Peruvians get mad.

The Bolinhos had good flavors, but were cold inside, and had an unpleasant rancid taste probably from the frying oil. Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka. Also because we left the restaurant with disappointment and confusion, and it used to be satisfaction with exceptional food and amazing service a few months ago.",2 months ago,Kinciyang B√∏ng

The Italian server was great, very friendly and explained quite well although we were only given 1 menu and he was back within 1 minute to see if we had decided. We were 4 of us. I felt a little rushed. We had the Smalhans and all the food was very tasty. However the pasta was very over cooked and all stuck together which was a pity because the taste was delicious. The sheep and the white fish were very good. Also we had 1 gluten free person in the group which they accommodated but for the gluten free dish, they gave 2 dishes with the same amount so 1 person who was not gluten free also had to eat gluten free. I  felt for the price we paid, the portions could have been slightly bigger. The other servers spoke in very low voices when they served the different dishes so it was very hard to hear what they were saying since the place was full and quite noisy. I expected more but looking at the recent reviews, they are not great either so maybe this place is not what it used to be. I won‚Äôt be coming back in a hurry. I forgot to take photos.

7620,Smalhans,4.3,1.0,"The first time I came here, it was wonderful. Great food and a unique experience; I truly felt it was one of the best restaurants in Oslo. However I came again last week and it suddenly became the worst meal for the price that I've had. Slow service (though the waitress was very kind and of course it's not her fault), unusual wine pairings, and worst of all, an utter lack of flavour in the food. We literally had to ask for salt to give it some taste, and we normally under-salt our food. Along with that, the fish was was chewy and slightly overcooked, the vegetables were very woody and I had to pull strings of fiber out of my mouth because they couldn't be broken down. I appreciate a good mix of cuisines, but starting off with a makeshift tostada paired with cured meats, then moving to woody vegetables in a bland broth paired with overcooked fish on pieces of salad in bland broth, then overcooked bland fish with capers and zero other flavour, then onto an Asian style meat with bok choy; I mean it was just a strange combination and the paired meals did not complement eachother.

The only decent thing about the meal was the dessert, which was a brownie that could have been made from a Toro package and nobody would have known the difference.

Overall, a huge disappointment compared to the great first experience I had here. For the price I paid and the utterly underwhelming food I received, I don't plan on returning.",10 months ago,Sharon
7621,Smalhans,4.3,2.0,"Surprised in a negative way!

- We ordered 2 ‚Äúfull menus‚Äù including 7 courses
- All courses (including the main course) were brought in a single plate for us to share. Many of them felt like they were meant for 1-1,5 person. To give an example: The duck appetizer was only 1 brochette for 2 people - so we questioned if we only ordered one, would it have been the half?!
- Total 7 courses menu took 3 hours : not because we ate too slow, but we waited tooo long in between the courses. Even the cheese plate took more than 20mins to arrive!
The family in the next table had to leave before desert (even though they paid for it).
It seemed like a problem in the kitchen, since there were 4 people to serve - which seemed quite enough for the restaurant.
- We drank a wine definitely overpriced for its quality !! We paid the same price for a much better bottle just one day before in another restaurant !!

Overall: Smalhans is overpriced for the service and portions it offers.

I will try this again soon and hope the employees won‚Äôt argue like last time. Burger gets 3,5/5, fries get 4,5/5. What‚Äôs missing on the burger is more toppings, better meat.

I like sitting in, as the interior is really casual and clean, with comfy seats.

I love that they use high quality Stange chicken & beef from Str√∏m-Larsen. Chorizo burger has a lot of flavour, but the chilli might be even tastier with it's awesome sauce.

Quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Comfortably low music volume.üëçüé∂
Toast is served until 15:00 as a lunch special. Wraps, burgers & all sides are served all day, but on Fridays and Saturdays there is a smaller night menu from midnight until 03:30 (last order is 03:15, only for take-away).
Night menu on weekends is a choice of 4 burgers, with or without the menu (which is potatoe wedges, either a bottled drink or freshly pressed orange juice & 2 dips: aioli + BBQ.)

Honestly, the prices are really great for what you're getting and for this area. Especially considering the higher quality of ingredients.

AMBIANCE,

Fried mystery cubes were ok but texture was spongy and moist. Dip was ok but you get the more watery texture cause of vegan mayo based. Do not recommend this.

Skagenr√∏re was very close knockoff ot the real one. Love that they used chick peas, and picked carrots as fake salomn. It workes so well recommend.

I had imagined the soft cheese in the description to be a cream cheese, but it was in fact a harder cheese that had melted in the cooking process, and that, combined with the shredded wheat, the syrup and the icecream made for a really different, but tasty, experience.

Interesting concept, I'd call it 'sushi for begginers'. The interior has some Japanese touches, but does not resemble the minimalistic approach of a traditional sushi restaurant. Also, the menu has a few unusual choices including sweet potato fries served directly on maki rolls.

7694,Sumo Restaurant Solli Plass,4.0,5.0,"Sumo is a popular place with multiple restaurants in town. They have alot of food to offer in the medium+ price range.

The service was on spot. Fast and friendly. We ordered a sharing plate for 3 and we were not dissapointed. So many colours and combos, which I have not tasted before. They have some crazy combos with strawberry,  sour cream and sriracha.

It was a wholesome experince and one of the best sushi places I have been to. Price was a wee bit above budget, but well worth it.",5 months ago,zimbala X

7696,Sumo Restaurant Solli Plass,4.0,5.0,"After 3 days of photoshoots in the Frogner area, only eating in the room to save time, I wanted some real food. So, I headed towards Aker Brygge, but passed by this new sushi restaurant on the way. Got curious, and went inside.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I was led to my table, seated next to the most beautiful wine cooler/fridge I have EVER seen. Maybe 4-6 cubic meters in size, it was made of transparent glass, illuminated with many different colors, making the wine bottles inside sparkle and shine. I was already sold.... üò±üòç

I ordered a 20 piece combo platter for 399 NOK. Very reasonable price for that much sushi in a restaurant. When it arrived, it looked like food art that shouldn't be touched, just gazed upon in awe....
It tasted like a piece of heaven. Half of the pieces had flavored sour cream on top of them. Sounds unusual maybe, but all I can say is - TRY IT! Melted in the mouth.

To make things even more interesting, the waiter that served me turned out to be the operations manager. He shared about the other branches in Bergen, a new opening in √Ösane soon (close to home), and... Told me that if I liked the decorations in the restaurant, I really should go to the bathroom.... üòÇüôÉ You will understand why if you check my pictures. The pictures from the stair going down all show the level of detail put into the bathroom. Just imagine how nice the interior design upstairs is...

If you want an out-of-this-world sushi experience that doesn't cost you an arm and a leg, this is the place to go. And ohhh.... They have outdoor seating with live DJ music, too... Sushi, 5th Element style üòçüòçüòç",5 years ago,Levi

7698,Masala Politics,4.5,1.0,We went for dinner & turned out to be extremely spicy (i was literally drenched in sweat because of the spiciness). The ordering experince was very different as they handed a yellow card (not in english) and a pen to write the menu item number and spice level. No one in the restaurant told us the level of spiciness they will add from 1 to 5. We ordered three dishes with level 3 and 4 based on our 5+yrs of experience in ordering in Indian restaurants in the EU. But level 3 and 4 was on a different level!!! We had to get some milk and ice creams in a grocery store nearby to manage the spiciness. We asked about this to the waitet and his response was this is the level they give to indias here!! Over all a very disappointing experience!!!!! üòû,7 months ago,mohan v

Wasn't in the mood to drink anything either, yet the server was kind enough to give me a glass of water.

Coming to the food, wow. I have been to Thailand over 10x in my life so I think I can comment on the authenticity of food. Portion was very generous and the food was really really tasty.

Mislead by the positive reviews, I ordered butter chicken, kadai chicken and butter naan.

The nan was like a pizza base or middle eastern Khubz. Butter chicken was too sweet with added sugar. The grilled chicken in the butter chicken was red in colour. I felt it was marinated in food colour (no chilly can give this colour). The karai chicken was disguesting in appearance and taste. Seems the oil in the food was rancid, I still get bad reflux.

We have tried their 5-courses menu and were blown away. All the dishes were delicious, but my favourites were halibut with chili, pickled cactus and charcoal pineapple (omg !) served with tortillas; and a crispy dough fritter with cream fraisch ice cream (!) - compliments to the chef!
I‚Äôm sure I will be returning many times to this place, looking forward to the new dishes on the menu.

7844,La Mayor,4.8,5.0,"Long story short: I recommend this place! If you want a more in-depth review, read on.

I got the 5-course set meal with my partner. I have attached photos of all the courses for reference.

Drinks:
We had a bottle of sauvignon blanc which was really, really terrible... Nutty and sour? Genuinely 1.5/5 But I ignored that and drank it anyway because it was 700 kr and I felt awkward that it had already been opened!

We tried two of the cocktails: the Paloma, and one which was ""spicy"" with tequila I think. I would recommend the spicy tequila one for someone looking for an interesting drink to entertain their tastebuds, and the Paloma for someone who wants a long, fruity cocktail.

Food:
We had a complimentary small bite of beef tongue (?). Whatever it was, it was SO good. Probably my favourite dish and it wasn't even part of the menu! 5/5

- 1st course: scallop, orange and pomegranate ceviche. It's not what I would typically think a ceviche is, but that's what it was described as. The scallops were tasteless themselves, but had that nice squishy texture. All the flavours came from the really really flavourful soup, which was passion fruit and spice. It wasn't necessarily something that I would like to eat more of, but it was (and I know how pretentious this sounds) entertainment for my tastebuds. 4/5

- 2nd course: tamal. I have no recollection of what was in this to be honest, except that it was in a jalape√±o sauce, but it was delicious. 5/5

- 3rd course: white fish tacos. I can't remember what fish this was, but the concept was that it came in this sauce with pineapple in the leaf plate, and soft tacos were served on the side to give one the option to build their own taco. The fish didn't stand out to me, it needed salt, but once I salted it it was good enough. 4/5.

- 4th course: octopus in mole sauce. I had never had mole sauce, from what I remember of the description it is a very complex sauce that contains chocalte amongst many other things... I wasn't a massive fan of the sauce, but I know that it is authentically mexican and it's just a preference. I could tell that the sauce was good, even if not my taste. The octopus was cooked perfectly though! Not rubbery at all. I was so so impressed by this because I adore a well-cooked octopus. It's so hard to get one that's nice and soft and well-seasoned like this. Just for the cooking of the octopus, 5/5

- 5th course: deep fried dessert with orange zest and ice cream. This isn't a dessert I would order otherwise, but given the previous dishes, it was a great choice. It complimented the previous flavours very well. It was sweet enough, but also refreshing with the orange zest. 5/5

The service was very good. The waitors explained the dishes well and were incredibly professional - made it feel like a luxury experience.",2 months ago,Kalina Christev
7845,La Mayor,4.8,5.0,"The heavens came down to us in the shape and taste of octopus mole. Done to perfection, such complexity and divine taste.

I understand that cross contamination can be difficult when you use the same tools, even though generally, a good wash and some care is all it takes.

7984,DimSum by Taste Of China,4.4,2.0,"Lunched there on 25th June 22. Very average or below average dimsums with too thick skins !!. The Xiaolong bao was dry and the waitress told us this is the Cantonese way. I wanted to tell her that I lived in Hong Kong for a few years and have never eaten or heard of Cantonese Xiaolong bao üòÇ. It is either from Mainland or Taiwan and always has soup inside. Also they served deep fried ravioli and samosas and stuff like that before the siumai/ hargaw with overthick coating. Deep fried stuff kinda spoils the appetite for the more delicate dim sums.
Peking duck was good though.
To conclude, if you want to eat dimsum which tastes even remotely like the real thing, then this is probably not the place to be.

8004,SKAAL Matbar,4.4,2.0,"This place became our favorite after several visits. Although I don‚Äôt live in Oslo anymore, having a meal at Skaal has become a must-do for me every time when I‚Äôm back here. However, our experience this time disappointed us, big time. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore, at least until they change the menu again. The two stars I gave here are even a bit generous, but one of the stars is for the good wine, the other one gives credit to the good job they used to do.

First, the service had been extremely friendly, helpful and passionate before. I could recall the waiters still smiling to everyone and trying to engage with the customers all the time on full-house rush hours. This time though, some of the waitresses had this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t‚Äù kind of attitude ‚Äî sort of rushing us to order, never explained the food in details like they used to do before, and didn‚Äôt even notice that our water bottle was empty. (Please note that we were one of the 4 tables dining at the time) We were shocked that the service style went from maximal attention down to less than minimal. Worst of all, no one ever asked how our food was, which was incredibly strange. We had 6 dishes, which means they had plenty of chances to check on us but they simply didn‚Äôt.

Second, as mentioned above that no one ever cared to ask if the food was good, here‚Äôs an answer: generally awful ‚Äî bear in mind that this is not a cheap eatery. In regard of the pricing, one of the dishes was good, three were ok, two were just edible.

The only good one was the oysters. They managed to buy good quality oysters and opened them without leaving pieces of shells on the flesh, bravo. The clear slightly spicy sauce served with the oysters, which was obviously allegedly a style of ‚Äúleche de tigre‚Äù, was good. Maybe change the name before Peruvians get mad.

The Bolinhos had good flavors, but were cold inside, and had an unpleasant rancid taste probably from the frying oil. Crispy Aubergine had been our all-time favorite dish, but the sauce was way too acidic and salty this time. The hummus wasn‚Äôt seasoned properly as they did (to perfection, which beats most Middle Eastern places in Norway), and the aubergine was soggy. The tastes weren‚Äôt balanced to our surprise, becaue it‚Äôs what we found the most impressive at Skaal. Broccolini was deep-fried beautifully, sauce was ok-ish, but the pickles were meh.

The Veal Breast (Kalvebryst) was weird. The meat itself wasn‚Äôt seasoned enough, but the sauce was so heavy and greasy that the tastes and mouthfeels combined weren‚Äôt that pleasant. It‚Äôs edible but not enjoyable.

The Laksa Curry was a real disaster ‚Äî first, yes, fusion sometimes can be a bit of a confusion, at Skaal as well, but in a good way. They were excellent at playing with flavors. This thingy we got didn‚Äôt remotely taste like curry laksa. It was missing too many elements that it could only be called, at best, Norwegian Thai curry. Second, the fish (skate) had a good texture, but an awful irritant aftertaste that disgusted us a bit. Maybe it‚Äôs supposed to taste like that, but we felt sick as we finished the dish.

We didn‚Äôt really talk about anything else than how disappointed we were. Our conclusion was maybe they have a new team now ‚Äî different chef, waiters, maybe owner, so much lower quality. I asked the waitress if there had been any changes with the team, she simply said ‚Äúno, everything is the same‚Äù and left without caring about why we asked. We wanted to confirm if the chef was in a bad mood that affected the food but she seemed to not allow follow-up questions.

Although they seems to not care about reviews here that much, I do hope they will manage to read what happened as mentioned above. Simply because they could do much better, like they used to, providing one of the best dining experiences in L√∏kka. Also because we left the restaurant with disappointment and confusion, and it used to be satisfaction with exceptional food and amazing service a few months ago.",2 months ago,Kinciyang B√∏ng

8139,Boulangerie M,4.5,5.0,"Original review from @croissantsofoslo (instagram)

A hidden pearl!

We were quite surprised, to find an authentic French boulangerie specimen in Ensj√∏. It was like stumbling across an Edelweiss on a beach in Fidji!

Regardless, the store has all the hallmarks of an authentic boulangerie and they excel at their craft. Just seeing breads and baked goods on trays, fresh out of the oven is worth a visit. Our brightest hope is that Boulangerie M will expand and open more locations around Oslo, so that at last, civilisation through ü•ñ and ü•ê can be brought to our great city.

We only review croissants so here is our opinion on the one we had.

Price: ca 35 nok

Look and feel 5/6:
It is humongous, seldom have we seen such a large ü•ê. It is light despite the volume ,a very good first impression is confirmed by a magnificent cross section. This ü•ê is super flaky, eating ü•ê should be messy and we ‚ù§ this one for it.

Taste 5/6:
Refined and balanced. The butter does not dominate and leaves room for the yeast and dough to express themselves. Great texture with a crispy crust and soft interior.

Value for money 6/6:
Amazing quality for the price, they also have coffee and croissants deals which seem too good to be true.

When to have this croissant:
When you are curious as to what a real boulangerie feels like. If we lived closer, we would be there at least once a week. We also ‚ù§ The cinnamon cruffins but that's another story üòâ.",2 years ago,Croissants of Oslo

8173,Snadder&Vin,4.6,3.0,"The concept is nice; small dishes to share and wine to match these dishes. You can order √† la carte or chose their tasting menu which is offering good amount of food for a very reasonable price and saves you from struggling between many options in the menu :)
Good sides: the waitress was really good! She was attentive and her wine selection for us was very accurate! The atmosphere is nice. The amount of food is good, the variation of the selected dishes in the tasting menu is good.
Not so good sides: the wine menu looked a bit overpriced. At least compared to the sophistication level of the dishes. Some of the dishes lacked taste and some of them were just giving a junk food feel with the garnitures and the sauces in them. The average bottle price of a wine is around 2500kr there and I cannot imagine pairing such expensive wine with some of these dishes. So I think there is some room for improvement for developing some of their dishes. The wine list is very large and I am definitely not expert on all of these wines but I can normally easily select a wine type that I would like. Here it was impossible because whatever grape I chose, the bottle price was nothing less than 2000kr. I saw couple of cheaper options around 600kr but I didn‚Äôt know those wines. So we decided to go for by glass option since we also couldn‚Äôt agree what type of wine we would drink. Menu doesn‚Äôt contain the by glass options. So you have to go and read the blackboard on the wall to select a wine. This is not easy, it‚Äôs not written in a nice order which makes it a long and difficult task. So we just trusted the waitress and she did an excellent job. We don‚Äôt know how much each glass was costing but the bill wasn‚Äôt heavy at the end. So I guess she was able to serve us delicious wine for reasonable price :) I think we would like to go there again but not for the full menu. Some selected dishes and some good wine by the glass. Another note: the window seats at the front is actually a good idea but it‚Äôs freezing there. Some heating would be good :)",a year ago,Pelin Smines

8430,Fly Chicken Storo,3.9,1.0,"I just bought a house nearby and was hoping I‚Äôd love this place. Sadly it‚Äôs the opposite.

I‚Äôm an American and have some expectations for fried chicken. It should be crispy. It should be fresh. There shouldn‚Äôt be skin under the breading.

This place seems like one of those shady kebab shops dressed up as a chicken chain. The chicken isn‚Äôt crispy and I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt brine it before frying. The chicken had skin; this should always be removed before breading and frying.

The fries tasted like they were fried in old oil. I know this flavor ‚Äî I used to work for a potato chip company and know when oil isn‚Äôt fresh.

Very disappointed. It‚Äôs Norway, and I know it‚Äôs not America. But frying a chicken shouldn‚Äôt be that hard, and I‚Äôm willing to pay 150 nok (15 USD) for a decent chicken sandwich that costs $4 in the states. This just really really misses the mark.

8435,Koie Ramen,4.4,5.0,"Was there with my friend yesterday. Ostegata is rn the best ramen in Oslo and closest to the umami taste of Japanese. The tonkotsu was really good. Taste has evolved a lot better and no more corona bland broth lol haha! Creamy qualified clean broth (i mixed up the black drops so it looks mushy in the foto). I ended the dish without remember to add chili oil. So it was a compliment for you. Chasiu was better with no stinky pork and light, even tho it wasnt chared and doesnt taste anything seasoned. Food size was perfectly served out.
Karaage was super cripsy, soft, warm homemade majo was creamy and a litte touch of sour lemon, delicious.
Plus point for being unique with the karaage since japanese shops are never meant to be similar.
I havent order gyoza or kimchi this time, so if you do experience, do tell.
When you see a long snake line outside waiting to eat you know its good.
Shop is casually clean, and bathroom is nice. They just need to check if bathroomwas dirt more often.
Good for a small group and cozy people who love to enjoy a close enough japanese culture, and good for Asians who miss the taste of those local slurps down the streets in the city.üçª

8451,Villa Paradiso Gr√ºnerl√∏kka,4.3,1.0,"Disappointing and don‚Äôt worth the money. I had high expectations by the reviews so I made a reservation for a date. In our case we ordered two pizzas gluten free (which I asked before doing the reservation) and the result was disgusting. The ingredients are very low standard and the amount quite questionable. The bases were raw (both of them) and also all the ingredients fell off the slices. The ‚Äútomato sauce‚Äù was horrendous and tasted like water without any flavor. The waiters were kind and diligent, but they didn‚Äôt ask anything when we left the place with more than half pizzas left over. Besides the disaster food, they also charge 30 extra NOKs per each gluten free pizza, which is frozen and NOT hand made at all, it‚Äôs a shame on a Italian restaurant, if you cannot deliver something in a bare minimum standard please don‚Äôt offer it. I won‚Äôt come back never, and I would advise the same to people with gluten intolerance. I didn‚Äôt order any regular pizza, maybe that‚Äôs is better but I wouldn‚Äôt expect much from a place that doesn‚Äôt even know how to properly cook a pizza doing dozens a day.

-We got bubble tea, and didn't get a single tapioca Pearl. Which is the entire reason to get bubble tea(!!)
We ordered 4 maki rolls, and got one small lump of wasabi and about a spoonful of soy sauce
-They're expensive. We tried them because we thought it would be fancier. But it didn't even taste good. Though cold tempura is already hard to defend, the breading was stale and tasted burned oil and the tofu was soggy.

8525,Pillefyken,4.7,4.0,"This caf√© is a small place slightly outside of city centre of Oslo. It gave me a sustainable vibe, from the menu to other products being sold there. Wooden floors and mismatched furniture gives it an overall homey feel. Waiting time for the food was nothing out of the ordinary. About 20 minutes or so.

This sandwich inspired me to create my own sour dough starter. The bread is THAT good. Like a thick slice of sour dough pillowy goodness topped with goat's cheese, brussel sprouts and anchovies. I have since bought sour dough and recreated this at home. I'm not sure as to how the brussel sprouts are prepared but there's a bit of crunch to them but they're not raw.
The dip and vegetables were also a nice addition to the meal. This meal is great as a lunch and you can add on more things from the menu to make it brunch.

We paired the meal with a forest brew made from fir shoots, lemongrass and yarrow. Very interesting combination. The flavour was earthy and reminiscent of kombucha/beer/bubbly wine. It was not as earthy as I expected from the description. I think the lemongrass really lifts the overall flavour, making it light.

1. For crispy duck, looks can be deceiving. Even though the duck looks pulled, it actually tasted heavenly and full of flavor. My number 1

2. For mongolia beef, brought memories of my time while I was at China.  Spicy yet deliciously satisfying.  Tempted me to order more rice. My number 2.

3. Seafood Pot Spicy. Didnt enjoy this one as there was one ingredient that really tasted fishy well obviously it was seafood but fishy that i didnt like. My last on the list

4. Dessert. Passable nothing really special since this was all just fruits and sorbet.  Could have sprinkled something like crumble berries.

All in all, i think the price was reasonable. I would have changed seafood pot with something else if possible.

8632,Handmade Burger & Shake,3.9,1.0,"Was really excited to try this as they recently opened at St hanshaugen! Had a long day and was extremely hungry..
Hunger is the best sauce - but it did nothing to help what ever this was.

Ordered the following:
Strawberry milkshake
Hot chick
Sweet potato fries
Onion rings
Freddy's BBQ
Total of 428 kr

Like someone mentioned earlier, I have not the slightest inkling on  what is actually handmade here... And none of the food came even close to the photos online. I'm inclined to believe they use stock photos..

The bbq burger was ok. The onion rings was the most tasty - I give them a 4/10.
Sweet potato fries was too well done.

The shake tasted like mass-produced factory shake with too much sugar and artificial flavor. If this was indeed homemade, they are doing something very wrong.

I was not even able to finish half of my hot chick. At first I thought they had given me the wrong order, as the chicken looked more like a badly beaten vegan patty. The whole thing was drenched in sauce - Wich tasted like ""a thousand islands"" mixed with chili. And when I say drenched... I mean it, See photo.
Will never come back here and will never recommend, I will go as far as to say I will beg other people not to leave their money here.

What could've been better. The service and most of the food.
The service - We had to wait a long time between each course, we thought they had forgotten about us even though it was far from crowded and waiters seemed uninterested. They didn't remove all the plates and cutlery before serving the next course. They didn't fill our water automatically. They didn't present the food only put it down on our table, one waiter did present the dessert. It was all very amateurish.

The food.
The guacamole had dried fish flakes on it but none of us were fond of the combination. Very small servings in general but that is common in fine dining.
The oysters could have been more salty and needed citrus, verdict was too oily.
My family had ceviche and pulled pork tacos. The ceviche was tasteless, needed more of the salty sea flavor and sweetness of the sweet potato was missing. My aunt only got one (!!!) corn kernel.
Pulled pork tacos was too dry, needed some cream or sauce.

We shared some great tapas, including a fried goat cheese and beetroot salad, empanadas, 'bikini' toast, perfectly cooked cod, patatas bravas and the intriguingly named 'roots', which turned out to be some yummy, roasted root vegetables. For dessert we had the sorbet of the day (mango) and the Catalan cheesecake. Not only was everything presented beautifully, but it was delicious too. I was really impressed with the professional and genuine service from our waiter, particularly when it came to paying the bill. I didn't get his name, but he is definitely a credit to the restaurant. Firstly, his explanation of how card payments work in Norway when I got confused was very helpful and polite. I wasn't aware it is the customer, not the server, who enters the amount. And secondly, when we asked if service charge was included (it wasn't) and were trying to work out the conversion to include a tip, he very kindly said we didn't have to because of the already high price of the meal compared to the UK.

We got a plank at the time with 3 dishes on it. If it did not contain anything you liked you were sat there waiting for a long while before something else arrived.

The location was loud and it was really hard to keep a conversation going.

The service was haphazard aswell. No water to the wine before late in the meal. No question wether a person would like wine at all. No one asked if anyone wanted some soft drinks.

All in all not very impressed. I make better tapas at home.",5 months ago,Leathal Blaze

Today I ordered the biff galangal with nuddles; the dish was full with sticky noodles that was not able to be pulled apart.

My last night in Oslo and I wanted to treat myself to something different - and I got it.
No menu! You don't choose your food, but instead get invited to a 10 course dinner of various foods , selected by the chef. The dishes are small of course and vary from sashimi to beef. (See photos). So much going on with each dish, very refined and very tasty. They serve you very nice accompanying wine as well.

It's a small establishment and very laid back. Loved the environment and choice of music, which reminded me more of a bar than a restaurant. In fact it was like a cocktail bar, but for food. Right up my street.
It's not on the cheap side though, but what is in Oslo.

I was also taken care of very well by the very friendly and attentive staff/waiters. Thanks guys!

I can understand if they applied this for the first time. But to apply the first promotion and changing it in few days for the free item size. Doesn‚Äôt seems nice and the price also. Its not about the price. Its about tricky strategy or wrong strategy in the beginning but just realize it now. Anyway i can say their fries is good one eventhought just normal fries.

On Fridays & Saturdays, Peloton stays open until 03:30 (am). What's awesome here is how quiet the volume is, so you can truly enjoy a relaxed conversation.
If you're looking to have food and drinks after a concert in Oslo, for example, I recommend eating at Cafe Sara across the street (they serve food all night) and then head to Peloton for drinks and good conversation after.",5 years ago,Olga Divakova

8886,Peloton,4.3,5.0,This is a restaurant and doesn't sell workout machines or bicycles as I first thought walking by. Good pizzas and beer in nice surroundings.  This is the place to go for pizza.,6 months ago,Tom Hardy

8888,ASIA Aker Brygge,4.1,5.0,"Great restaurant! Asian plates combined with some south American influences.
All fresh tasty delicious. We love the ceviche the salon tacos and the nigiris, all super good!
Wine selection is small, however good choices available.
The desserts was fantastic!!",5 months ago,javier rivero
8889,ASIA Aker Brygge,4.1,2.0,"Lovely staff,  beautiful interior,  disappointing food.  Had both takeaway and  a dine in experience. To call this 'asia' is just a complete misrepresentation of all Asian cuisines attempted. Oily vegetables  (hilariously small portion),  random fusions of flavours,  both soggy and dry meats,  just overall not an Asian restaurant I would recommend for authentic Asian cuisine.",6 months ago,N W
8890,ASIA Aker Brygge,4.1,5.0,The food was amazing and so was the vibe! The vegan bao buns are an absolute must and all the food we tried was super delicious üòç great vegan options as well üå±,3 months ago,Linda Okoren
8891,ASIA Aker Brygge,4.1,3.0,The vegan sushi was amazing and the mushroom bao buns was tasty and quantity worth the price. We got grilled asparagus and rice and the portion sizes were very small. There could be more vegan sauces since the green sauce was reused for all the three vegan items we ordered. But I appreciate having at least one vegan item for every category. The mango mocktail tasted great! I probably won't visit again until I'm old (so I'm satisfied with smaller portion sizes) and rich enough (it was 700 NOK for two people) to afford this place lol.,6 months ago,Niranjhana Narayanan
8892,ASIA Aker Brygge,4.1,5.0,"Amazing vegan sushi. So tasty, with really thoughtful sauces and garnishes. The vegan mushroom bao bun was also SO tasty.

The aubergine fries are ok but nothing to write home about. The sauce is really sweet. I'd order something else if I were you because the rest was great.

Marked down from 5 to 4 because of the aubergine, and also because our table was behind a big pillar blocking the lovely view of the marina, and my chair kept getting knocked by waiters and guests walking past. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.",a month ago,Charlotte Owen
8893,Jewel of India Restaurant,4.5,5.0,"The restaurant is very nice and interested with Indian styling, The food is perfect and delicious , the best thing about it is you can choose how much spicy üå∂ in your meal is, it is perfect for me because I do not like spicy food ( From 1 to 6 level of spicy I chosen 1 and it was good ) Of course I will go there another dayüòãüòãüòãüòã",6 months ago,Mariam
8894,Jewel of India Restaurant,4.5,5.0,"I have been to almost every Indian restaurant in Oslo and I can surely say that this is the BEST out of them all.

Tasty food, Good Portions. Good Service.

If you love spicy food ( A level more than the Indian Spice (HOT) level ) you can inform the waiter while ordering. I loved the spice and enjoyed it. Definitely recommended!!",4 months ago,Yogesh Reddy
8895,Jewel of India Restaurant,4.5,5.0,"Best Indian restaurant I have been in Europe. I really like the thin bread/appetizer with the sauces. Spicy and tasty.

I recommend the chef's special, ""chicken chettihad"" for main dish, and the carrot cake ""Indian style"" for dessert. Chicken tikka is also really nice. Staff is friendly. Worth every krone, will be back.",a year ago,Balder Jacobsen
8896,Jewel of India Restaurant,4.5,5.0,The best and the most authentic Indian restaurant I have eaten at in Norway. I always eat here when I am in Oslo. They also accommodate families with small babies. We were allowed to keep the stroller with our sleeping baby inside but you will need to take it down a small flight of stairs. There is also outdoor dining but faces the street with nothing to look at. The decorations in the restaurant is authentic North Indian and warm lighting adds to the experience.,3 months ago,Yashwanth Subbannayya
8897,Jewel of India Restaurant,4.5,5.0,"Really good Indian food. Authentic experience. Every bit of the food was cooked to perfection - the nan was crispy and soft at the same time. The tandoori chicken was tender, appropriately spicy and with a tasty gravy on the side. Golden rice - everything just the way you want it to be. Waiters were easy to reach, but not too pushy. Service was very good. I requested my dish without nuts, and this was no problem. If you crave indian food, you won't regret coming here!",4 years ago,Lasse R√∏vik
